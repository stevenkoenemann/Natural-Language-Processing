2013-11-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period of September through early October. Eight Districts reported similar growth rates in economic activity as during the previous reporting period, while growth slowed some in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Contacts across Districts generally remained cautiously optimistic in their outlook for future economic activity, although many also noted an increase in uncertainty due largely to the federal government shutdown and debt ceiling debate. 
Consumer spending continued to increase and activity in the travel and tourism sector expanded in most Districts. Business spending and payrolls grew in many Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services rose, and manufacturing activity also expanded modestly. Residential construction continued to increase at a moderate pace. By comparison, nonresidential construction again expanded at a slower rate. Residential and commercial real estate activity varied across Districts, but largely continued to improve. Financial conditions were little changed on balance, with lending activity remaining modest in most Districts. There were mixed reports on agriculture, with excess precipitation and drought both impacting the sector. Energy and mining activity expanded or maintained high levels, with the exception of the coal industry in the eastern half of the nation. Price and wage pressures were again limited. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending grew modestly in most Districts. Auto sales continued to be strong, particularly in the New York District where they were said to be increasingly robust. In contrast, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated slower growth in auto sales in September. Growth in retail sales was steady in most of the Districts, but picked up some in Cleveland and Richmond and slowed in Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Contacts in Chicago and Atlanta noted that back-to-school spending was lower

than a year ago. However, retailers generally remained optimistic about the holiday shopping season, with contacts in Philadelphia and Chicago expecting this year’s holiday sales to be about equal to last year’s despite the traditional holiday period being six days shorter this year. In addition, Dallas noted strength in retail imports in advance of the holiday season, with growth stronger than a year ago. 
Activity in the travel and tourism sector also expanded in most areas, with the reports from the Atlanta, Boston, and New York Districts being particularly upbeat. Dallas indicated that airline passenger demand slowed seasonally, but was slightly stronger than year-ago levels. Tourism contacts in the Boston District were concerned about the potential impact of a protracted federal government shutdown; and Richmond noted that the shutdown had led to the closing of some tourist attractions, although hotel contacts indicated that these closures did not result in guest cancellations. In addition, Kansas City noted lower tourism activity due in part to the severe effects of recent flooding in Colorado. Business Spending and Hiring 
Business spending grew modestly in most Districts. Overall, inventory investment proceeded at a moderate rate. Retail inventories were said to be in-line with sales in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Philadelphia and Cleveland reported that inventories were on the low side at auto dealers, and Chicago noted the same was true at steel service centers. Philadelphia reported an increase in manufacturers’ demand for equipment, while manufacturers in Cleveland and Chicago indicated that current capital outlays were primarily for productivity enhancing investments. Cleveland noted that low natural gas prices and regulatory uncertainty were slowing the build-out of shale-gas transport and processing infrastructure. In contrast, additional infrastructure projects to support natural resource extraction were mentioned in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Philadelphia and Chicago reported an increase in spending on information technology. Looking ahead, several Districts noted an improvement in capital spending plans. Manufacturers in Philadelphia and St. Louis, high-tech service firms in Kansas City, and retailers in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts expected to increase capital spending in the months ahead. Technology contacts in San Francisco relayed expectations for a 
iii 
near-term pick-up in spending on both hardware and software products. In addition, Philadelphia and Minneapolis reported slight increases in activity at architecture firms. 
Employment growth remained modest in September. Several Districts reported that contacts were cautious to expand payrolls, citing uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and fiscal policy more generally. Cleveland and Dallas noted that retail hiring was primarily limited to staffing of new stores in their Districts, while contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago reported that hiring for the holiday season would be about the same as last year. In manufacturing, Boston indicated that hiring primarily was for replacement or to fill key needs, New York noted slower job growth, and Chicago reported that manufacturers were cutting back on overtime. Dallas cited scattered reports of hiring in high-tech, fabricated metals, and food manufacturing. Furthermore, demand for skilled labor remained high in many Districts. Examples included technology, healthcare, and engineering occupations in Richmond, economic and health consulting in Boston, legal and compliance positions in the financial services industry in New York, and accountants and financial analysts in the Dallas District. Nonfinancial Services 
Demand for nonfinancial services increased modestly from the prior reporting period. Boston reported robust growth in consulting, but noted that activity at a government consulting firm remained weaker due to the effects of sequestration. The Minneapolis District reported increased activity in professional business services, whereas demand was more mixed in the Dallas District with strength in accounting services and a modest decrease in legal services. Demand for staffing services increased in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis Districts, with New York citing strong demand for information technology occupations and Cleveland highlighting healthcare and manufacturing. In contrast, staffing service activity was down slightly in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Demand for technology services increased in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, but San Francisco indicated that overall demand for nonfinancial services was mixed with healthcare services somewhat weak. Demand for transportation services increased on balance. Port activity remained robust in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, reflecting exports of grain, auto parts, and forest products and imports of energy 
iv 
products and steel. Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas cited a modest rise in demand for transportation services. Cleveland reported that the rate of growth in shipping freight volume had slowed recently, and demand for trucking services softened slightly in the Richmond District. Manufacturing 
Overall, manufacturing activity expanded modestly in September, but with some notable exceptions among the Districts. Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis experienced faster growth, while New York, Richmond, and Chicago saw growth weaken. The automotive and aerospace industries continued to be a source of strength in a number of Districts. Demand for fabricated metals was mixed in the Chicago and Richmond Districts, but stronger in the Dallas District. Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported steady increases in the demand for steel; Cleveland, Chicago, and Atlanta indicated that much of the higher demand was being met by imports. Demand for construction materials remained strong for Philadelphia, increased for Cleveland and San Francisco, was flat for Dallas, and was slightly lower for the Chicago District. Cleveland and Dallas reported strong demand for manufactured inputs to energy production, and demand for heavy equipment improved slightly in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. High-tech manufacturing activity edged up in a number of Districts, with Boston and Dallas reporting slightly higher demand for semiconductors, and biotech manufacturing increasing in San Francisco. While there was little immediate disruption from the federal government shutdown, contacts were worried about the potential impact if the closing became prolonged. Construction and Real Estate 
Construction and real estate activity continued to improve in September. Residential construction increased moderately on balance, growing at a stronger pace in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts but only slightly in Richmond and Philadelphia. Multifamily construction remained stronger than single- family construction in a number of Districts. Residential real estate activity continued to improve at a moderate pace in most Districts, as home sales and prices continued to rise and inventories remained low. Home sales in the New York and Dallas Districts were strong, with the exception of the Jersey Shore, which is still recovering from Hurricane Sandy. The Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts 
v 
experienced a more modest improvement in home sales. A number of Districts reported concerns from homebuilders and realtors over rising mortgage rates. However, contacts in the Dallas District indicated that rising interest rates were not hurting affordability and contacts in the Boston District suggested some boost to activity by homebuyers entering the market in anticipation of future increases in rates. Nonresidential construction activity remained modest, but varied by market and District. Growth was strong in the Minneapolis District, but up only slightly in Richmond, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. The Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts reported increased activity for industrial building, Cleveland noted strong demand from the healthcare sector, and redevelopment of vacant retail space picked up in Boston. Leasing activity continued to improve modestly in most Districts, but was particularly strong in the Dallas District. A number of Districts reported that vacancy rates continued to fall, rents rose, and the outlook for commercial real estate was generally positive. 
Banking and Finance 
Financial conditions were little changed on balance from the prior reporting period. Overall loan growth remained modest in most Districts. Consumer loan demand weakened slightly. Reports on mortgage lending were mixed. Several Districts noted a decrease in mortgage lending, citing higher mortgage rates and reduced refinancing activity. However, mortgage originations continued to rise in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas, and rising home prices led to an increase in home equity lending in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco. Chicago, Cleveland, and Atlanta noted an increase in auto lending, while credit card volumes decreased slightly in Philadelphia. Business loan demand edged higher, with several Districts noting a pick-up in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported intense competition on pricing and terms for commercial and industrial loans. In addition, contacts in Philadelphia and Chicago expressed concern about an easing of credit standards on these loans. Overall, however, lending standards were largely unchanged and credit quality continued to improve moderately. 
vi 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Heavy rains hurt agriculture in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, even resulting in declarations of some natural disaster areas. At the other extreme, some portions of the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts experienced drought conditions, although they eased in some areas over the reporting period. Harvests were reported as behind their normal pace. Nonetheless, crop yields were higher than expected in the Chicago District and about average in the Kansas City District. Strong fruit output was noted in the Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts. Cotton output was mixed across the South. Prices fell for corn, soybeans, wheat, hay, cotton, hogs, broilers, turkeys, and eggs, but rose for rice, citrus, grapes, milk, cattle, and dry beans. Livestock producers benefited from lower feed costs, as well as higher beef exports according to the Dallas District. San Francisco reported demand remained strong for most crop and livestock products. 
Natural resource extraction increased in September. Oil and natural gas activity remained at high levels in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, was solid in the Kansas City District, and expanded in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. Drilling rig counts were stable in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts, although the latter reported a shift in rigs from oil drilling toward natural gas. This shift was driven in part by expectations of higher natural gas prices and lower oil prices in the future. Atlanta and Dallas noted steady demand for energy. San Francisco indicated that demand for oil products edged up, resulting in increased refinery activity. Refinery expansions continued in the Atlanta District, although the cost of transporting inputs to Gulf Coast refineries rose. Mining activity picked up in the Minneapolis District. Coal production in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts slowed, but output was higher in St. Louis and Kansas City. Prices and Wages 
Price pressures remained limited in September. Most Districts reported only slight increases in commodity prices and limited ability to pass through these increases to their customers. Metal prices fell slightly in the Chicago District, but held steady in Minneapolis and were up slightly in Dallas. The Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported upward pressure on prices for building 
vii 
materials such as asphalt, brick, lumber, and concrete, with Kansas City indicating that concrete was in short supply in the Colorado areas affected by flooding. Energy prices in most Districts were steady to slightly lower than during the prior reporting period. In general, prices for final goods were little changed, except for a faster increase in retail prices in the Richmond District and higher food prices in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Wage pressures remained modest overall, though the Minneapolis and Richmond Districts reported moderate wage increases. Most Districts reported continued upward wage pressure for skilled workers, particularly those in consulting, accounting, information technology, engineering, and skilled manufacturing and construction trades.",1,1
2013-10-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period of early July through late August. Eight Districts characterized growth as moderate; of the remaining four, Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported modest growth, and Chicago indicated activity had improved. Consumer spending rose in most Districts, reflecting, in part, strong demand for automobiles and housing-related goods. Activity in the travel and tourism sector expanded in most areas. Demand for nonfinancial services, including professional and transportation services, increased slightly on net. Manufacturing activity expanded modestly. Residential real estate activity increased moderately in most Districts, and demand for nonresidential real estate gained overall. Lending activity was mixed. Lending standards were largely unchanged, while credit quality improved. Demand for agricultural products was strong during the reporting period, but growing conditions and production in some areas were somewhat weak as a consequence of extreme weather. Demand for natural resource products was stable or up slightly, and extraction increased in anticipation of further demand growth. 
For most occupations and industries, hiring held steady or increased modestly relative to the prior reporting period. Upward price pressures remained subdued, and prices increased slightly during the reporting period. Wage pressures continued to be modest overall. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Reports indicated that consumer spending rose in most Districts. A few Districts mentioned that back-to-school sales contributed to overall consumer spending growth. Districts reported retail sales generally grew moderately in Boston, Kansas City, and Dallas; sales were mixed in New York; and sales grew more modestly in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Cleveland noted that sales came in below many retailers’ expectations, and Richmond indicated that sales revenues weakened. Boston noted that consumer confidence improved, while New York reported that it retreated a bit. According to reports from Boston, some retailers experienced robust demand gains, with “year-over-year comparable store sales increases between 4 and 5 percent.” Many Districts noted strong demand for home furnishing and home improvement items. However, reports from several Districts indicated that consumers remained cautious in their purchases and highly price-sensitive. For example,

ii 
Philadelphia observed that consumers engaged in “price-shopping,” as “sales of children’s apparel were stronger at outlets than at traditional malls.” 
Attractive financing conditions and pent-up demand supported a robust pace of automobile sales in most Districts. New York noted that sales of high-end brands were especially robust. Richmond reported that one dealership had its best sales month ever, and sales at another dealership doubled relative to twelve months earlier. Used vehicle sales were strong in Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco but a bit soft in New York. New car inventories rose or remained high in Cleveland and San Francisco, but dealers were generally satisfied with their inventory positions; by contrast, Minneapolis reported sales were constrained at some dealerships due to a lack of inventory. Reports from dealerships across the nation were optimistic about demand growth for new and used automobiles for the remainder of the year. 
Many Districts pointed to solid gains or high levels of travel and tourist activity, with pickups evident in both the business and leisure segments. Travel and tourism activity expanded overall in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Relative to the same period a year earlier, Richmond and Minneapolis reported that the number of camping permits and visitors at state and national parks in their Districts increased substantially. New York reported that business at Broadway theaters picked up since the previous reporting period, but Boston highlighted low attendance at some museums. New York and Kansas City both reported that some hotels experienced slightly lower occupancy rates, which may be a result of cutbacks in government travel. A few Districts indicated that business travel activity had also expanded. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Demand for nonfinancial services improved modestly overall since the previous Beige Book. Adjusting for seasonal fluctuations, providers of various professional and business services such as accounting, consulting, information, transportation, and legal services generally expanded their activities according to reports from Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Providers of staffing services in the Boston and New York Districts reported improved business conditions. Several Districts noted increased demand at restaurants, although San Francisco was an exception, with reports from parts of the District indicating that demand had eased. Health-care organizations in the Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts reported soft demand for various health-care services. Boston noted that sales of technology services to businesses and consumers were a bit weaker than expected, and reports from St. Louis indicated that some information technology firms may downsize their workforces. Cleveland indicated that ground cargo volumes were strong; Dallas reported an increase in railroad volumes but a decline in small parcel volumes; and Atlanta observed a decrease in overall trucking 
iii 
volumes. Both Cleveland and Atlanta noted a short supply of truck drivers as a consequence of new hours-of-service regulations. Air freight tonnage ran slightly above year-ago levels for the Atlanta District but was unchanged over the past six weeks for Dallas. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity expanded modestly during the reporting period. Kansas City noted a slight contraction in the previous reporting period but indicated that manufacturing activity had expanded moderately in recent weeks. Cleveland and Minneapolis also reported a moderate expansion, although Minneapolis specified that the pace of growth was uneven across District states. Atlanta noted a decrease in the pace of growth as indicated by modest decreases in new orders and production. Several Districts, including Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco, expressed that demand for inputs related to autos, housing, and infrastructure were strong. Chicago highlighted the auto industry as a main source of strength for that District’s overall manufacturing sector, and contacts there expect demand for heavy and medium trucks to ratchet up further and to support growth in overall manufacturing for the remainder of the year. By contrast, Cleveland was the only District to report that auto production activity declined, although reports specified that it was a normal seasonal pattern and sales were up relative to twelve months earlier. In the Richmond District, a lumber company purchased new equipment to expand its production; and in Chicago, demand for construction equipment and materials continued to strengthen. Philadelphia reported some increased demand related to ongoing repairs of infrastructure damaged during Superstorm Sandy last year. Reports from San Francisco indicated that shipments of steel products used in nonresidential construction continued to increase, and reports from Chicago indicated that steel output grew at a moderate pace. Boston and San Francisco noted increased demand for semiconductors. High-tech manufacturing firms in the Dallas District noted that demand was stable, and, while Kansas City District firms reported that sales dipped, contacts there expect sales to bounce back in the next three months. In general, contacts in most Districts expressed optimism about a near-term pickup in overall manufacturing activity. Production in the defense industry was mixed across Districts. Contacts in the Boston District reported minimal direct effects of the federal sequestration, although they were concerned about the prospect of larger effects in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, defense firms in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts reported that the effects of the sequestration have already been passed through to actual reductions in production. 
iv 
Real Estate and Construction 
Activity in residential real estate markets increased moderately. The pace of sales of existing single-family homes continued to increase moderately in most Districts. Sales activity in New York City’s co-op and condominium market was described as unusually strong in July and August, and the Cleveland District reported that year-to-date sales of existing single-family homes were up substantially relative to the same period last year. Reports from several Districts suggested that rising home prices and mortgage interest rates may have spurred a pickup in recent market activity, as many “fence sitters” were prompted to commit to purchases. Sales of new single-family homes stabilized during the past few months in the Cleveland District after accelerating earlier in the year. New home sales declined slightly in parts of the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts in July. Philadelphia conveyed that some borrowers apparently preferred to lock in a mortgage rate for an existing home rather than wait for a new home to be completed and chance higher mortgage rates. Home prices climbed in most Districts. Richmond and Boston reported that houses in some areas were staying on the market fewer days and increasingly receiving multiple offers. New York noted that bidding wars were common in the Buffalo area. Many Districts reported that limited inventories of desirable properties contributed to upward price pressures. Single-family home construction was strong in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts, and Chicago reported that a number of builders are planning new developments to begin later this year. However, several Districts noted constraints on the construction of single-family homes. San Francisco pointed to shortages of construction workers. In the Kansas City District, some building materials, such as drywall and roofing shingles, were in short supply. 
Demand for nonresidential real estate increased. Office vacancy rates and other indicators in markets for office space improved modestly in the major metropolitan markets in the New York, Richmond, and St. Louis and Districts. Rents for Class B office space in Manhattan have risen more than 10 percent over the past twelve months. Demand for commercial real estate showed strong growth in the Dallas District and moderate growth in the Minneapolis District. Both Districts reported new plans for construction of industrial space. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported modest growth in demand for commercial real estate. Philadelphia highlighted a shift in recent leasing activity toward larger commercial spaces. The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported increases in construction of multifamily residential properties. 
v 
Banking and Finance 
Lending activity weakened a bit, and several Districts reported less-favorable conditions than in the preceding reporting period. Most Districts indicated no better than modest growth. Loan growth in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts was slower than in the previous reporting period. Kansas City reported a decline in lending, reversing slight growth earlier in the summer. Several Districts characterized business lending as largely flat. Chicago reported that recent interest rate increases likely were depressing commercial investment. However, Kansas City noted that expectations for better economic conditions and stronger profit growth had offset any effects of rate increases on business loan demand. Demand for mortgage refinance loans declined in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts. By contrast, purchase mortgage lending continued to grow moderately in most Districts, although San Francisco noted that applications have dropped a bit in some areas of that District. In the Atlanta District, increases in home values generated a surge in second mortgages, and Philadelphia and Cleveland reported modest increases in demand for home equity lines of credit. 
Lending standards were largely unchanged, while credit quality improved. Reports indicated little change in standards across all lending categories. However, a few Districts commented that stiff competition for high-quality commercial borrowers was eroding loan volumes at banks that maintained prudent interest rates and terms. New York reported widespread declines in delinquency rates, especially for consumer loans and home mortgages, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City all reported general improvement in loan quality. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Demand for agricultural products expanded during the reporting period, although production activity was limited by extreme weather in some areas. Droughts or dry weather in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts constrained farming activity, but some growing areas within the Chicago and Dallas Districts were relieved by much-needed rainfall. By contrast, extremely wet conditions led to delayed planting and reduced yields for some crops in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. Kansas City noted that wheat production was below average and corn crops were threatened by disease, and Atlanta and Dallas indicated that the cotton crop was smaller than anticipated. Chicago noted that, despite the dry weather, corn and soybean crops were in better condition than they were during the drought last year. Meanwhile, the St. Louis District anticipates robust production activity, with corn crop yields expected to increase substantially over last year. San Francisco noted that demand was generally strong for most crop and livestock products, and Atlanta found that poultry farming and fruit production were robust. 
vi 
For producers of natural resource products, demand was mostly steady, while production and extraction activity rose. San Francisco reported a modest decline in demand for some oil products, and Dallas reported stable drilling activity at a high level. Contacts in San Francisco and Dallas expect near- to medium-term oil-related sales and production activity to pick up; contacts in Dallas and Atlanta expect drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico to increase as demand continued to grow. Richmond and Kansas City reported that the number of natural gas rigs increased, but coal production in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts was below year-ago levels. Minneapolis reported upgrades to a nuclear power plant and development of oil sands production facilities, and Cleveland noted that unconventional drilling activity increased. Mining activity was flat in the Minneapolis and Richmond Districts. 
Employment, Wages, and Prices 
For most industries and occupations, hiring held steady or increased somewhat in most Districts. Hiring in manufacturing rose modestly. St. Louis reported increases in employment at a variety of manufacturing firms connected to the auto industry or the home construction industry. Boston, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported shortages of some types of skilled manufacturing workers. Hiring increased for selected services occupations. Increases in demand for information technology workers were widespread. Hiring increased for workers in accounting and health services occupations in several Districts. Retail employment gains were limited. Atlanta reported slight employment increases in Georgia and Florida, and Dallas reported gains in oil and gas producing areas. Cleveland noted that retail employment increases were limited to new stores. Boston and Richmond reported that temporary workers are increasingly being offered permanent employment. A health-care staffing firm in the Boston District reported a 30 percent increase in permanent placements this year. Similarly, a staffing firm in the Dallas District reported “near-record” levels of direct hiring by health-care and engineering clients. 
Wage pressures remained modest overall. The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that wage pressures were largely subdued. Cleveland and Dallas highlighted that, overall, wage pressures at homebuilding and other construction-related firms were contained. New York reported that some firms have become increasingly willing to negotiate salaries, although pay rates have not escalated significantly. Reports from a few Districts highlighted significant labor supply constraints and, in some cases, large compensation increases for workers with specialized skills in selected sectors, including the construction and high-technology sectors in Atlanta and Kansas City and the engineering sector in Dallas. Kansas City also reported that some firms in the retail, leisure, and hospitality industries were beginning to raise wages to attract salespeople, housekeepers, maintenance 
vii 
staff, and clerical staff. Increases in the costs of employee health benefits continued to put upward pressure on overall compensation costs, although Minneapolis indicated that growth in the price of health- care has slowed. 
Upward price pressures were subdued, and price increases were limited during the reporting period. Reports from many Districts indicated modest growth, no change, or slight decreases in overall commodity and input prices. In a few Districts, prices of some construction inputs in short supply increased, including lumber, drywall, concrete, and roofing shingles. However, Cleveland noted that the rate of increase for construction input prices slowed, and lumber prices in the Chicago District declined. Dallas reported that law firms had reduced their billing rates slightly. Atlanta and Chicago reported that firms have limited pricing power in general. Similarly, food costs continued to increase in the Kansas City District, but most restaurant owners did not increase menu prices. However, Richmond reported that several construction-related businesses said that they were able to pass along rising input prices.",0,1
2013-08-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that overall economic activity continued to increase at a modest to moderate pace since the previous survey.

vi 
Banking and Finance 
Reports on banking conditions were generally positive across the Districts. Overall loan demand increased modestly across most reporting Districts. New York District bankers reported mixed but generally steady loan demand. Some bankers in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts noted competitive pressures to reduce loan pricing. Bankers in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts noted a shift toward new home mortgages and away from refinancing (which was led, in part, by increases in interest rates). 
Reports on credit quality indicated slight to moderate improvements across the reporting Districts. Improvements were noted by the New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Credit standards remained largely unchanged, although some bankers in the Atlanta and Philadelphia Districts noted increased competition to ease credit standards. Agriculture and Natural Resource Industries 
Agricultural conditions varied across the Districts because of differing weather conditions. Crop conditions improved in the Chicago and St. Louis Districts, while agricultural production increased in the San Francisco District and is expected to improve in the Kansas City District. Extremely wet conditions delayed planting and even resulted in some farmers in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts planting soybeans instead of corn. Excessive rains in the Richmond District also damaged the wheat crop in some areas. Contacts noted persistent drought conditions in some areas of the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts and in most of the Dallas District. Winter wheat harvest output yields were highly variable because of crop damage from freezing and drought in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. The condition of pastureland in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts improved since the previous report. 
vii 
Coal production was lower compared with the same time last year for the Cleveland, St. Louis, and Richmond Districts. Energy activity remained robust or steady at high levels in the Atlanta and Dallas District. Natural gas production was stable in the Cleveland District and continued to increase in the Richmond District. Drilling declined in the Cleveland District, was flat in the Kansas City District, and increased in the Richmond District. Oil and gas exploration was up slightly in the Minneapolis District. Mining was flat in the Kansas City District, weakened in the Chicago District, and was sluggish in the Minneapolis District. Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Hiring held steady or increased at a measured pace in most Districts. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts were cautious or reluctant to hire permanent or full-time staff. The Richmond and Chicago Districts noted relatively stronger demand for part- time workers. Transportation contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noted some difficulty finding qualified drivers. Contacts in the New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts reported high demand for technology workers. 
Most Districts reported that wage pressures remained limited or contained. The Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reported moderate wage pressures. The Chicago District noted that rising healthcare and other benefit costs were being passed onto employees. Contacts in the New York and San Francisco Districts noted that competition for technology workers had an effect on salaries. The Richmond District noted that wage growth picked up in the manufacturing sector, remained robust at non-retail establishments, and flattened at retail businesses. 
Overall consumer and input price pressures remained stable or modest in most reporting Districts, although some Districts noted price increases. Most notably, the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts noted upward pressures on the prices of 
viii 
construction materials. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported price increases for raw materials and finished goods among manufacturers. The New York District reported that input price pressures have abated further in manufacturing but remained widespread in services. Retail prices remained steady in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas District, while retail price growth slowed in the Richmond District and wholesale retail prices increased in the Chicago District.",1,0
2013-07-31,"Overall economic activity increased at a modest to moderate pace since the previous report across all Federal Reserve Districts except the Dallas District, which reported strong economic growth. The manufacturing sector expanded in most Districts since the previous Beige Book. Most Districts noted slight to moderate gains in consumer spending and a moderate increase in vehicle sales. Tourism showed signs of strength in several Districts. A wide variety of business services expanded, and transportation traffic increased for producer, consumer, and trade goods. Residential real estate and construction activity increased at a moderate to strong pace in all Districts. Commercial real estate and construction activity grew at a modest to moderate pace in most Districts. Overall bank lending increased since the previous report. Credit quality and deposits increased, while credit standards were largely unchanged. Agricultural conditions remained mixed across Districts, as weather patterns varied.

Hiring increased at a measured pace in several Districts, with some contacts noting difficulty finding qualified workers. Wage pressures remained contained overall, although several Districts reported a modest or moderate rise for selected occupations. Districts reported level prices to mild price increases; some manufacturers raised prices and some increases for input prices were noted. Manufacturing The manufacturing sector expanded in most Districts since the previous Beige Book. Activity increased in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Manufacturing contacts in the New York District reported steady business activity. In the Philadelphia District, manufacturers reported that orders and shipments have fallen somewhat, and in the Richmond District, manufacturing activity softened since the previous report, although there were scattered reports of improvement. Most firms in the Boston District are reasonably optimistic about the outlook, and many contacts in the Cleveland District believe that business conditions will continue to improve slowly during the second half of the year. However, the near-term outlook has waned somewhat in the New York District. 
Continuing a theme from the previous report, strength in residential construction was a boon to manufacturers who supplied that industry. Firms in the Philadelphia District supplying the home-

ii 
building sector reported strong orders, and the Cleveland District noted that suppliers to residential construction were among those seeing the strongest activity, while the Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported increased demand for lumber or wood products. Growth in the auto industry was noted by the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, although the Chicago District reported that the auto industry grew at a more moderate pace. Producers of inputs for the oil and gas industries saw growth in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta Districts. The food processing industry grew in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts. Electrical equipment saw increased activity in the Boston and San Francisco Districts but lower activity in the Philadelphia District. Demand for fabricated metals expanded in the Philadelphia District, while specialty metal manufacturers in the Chicago District reported small increases in new orders, noting that their customers had become more cautious. Fabricated metals producers in the Dallas District reported that demand remained steady for both private and public projects. 
The defense industry experienced weakening activity in the Cleveland District, and a producer of defense equipment in the Richmond District cited government sequestration and orders being canceled or delayed. Steel production was mixed. Steel producers in the Cleveland District reported that shipping volume was stable but remains below levels seen early in the first quarter, and both the Cleveland and Chicago Districts noted an increase in imports of steel. The St. Louis and San Francisco Districts reported an increase in demand for steel. Lower demand for primary metals was noted in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism Most Districts noted that consumer spending increased during the reporting period, ranging from slight to moderate gains. Retail activity in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts was characterized as modest or moderate, while the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported slight growth. Retailers in the New York District reported that sales were tepid in April but picked up in May. Meanwhile, the Richmond District noted that sales were flat during the reporting period. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts reported that late winter weather slowed retail sales; the Chicago District noted that sales picked up once warmer weather arrived. Demand for home furnishings and furniture was strong or picked up in the Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts; however, furniture sales slowed in the Chicago District. The Kansas City District reported that appliance purchases were particularly strong. Inventories were generally at desired levels in the 
iii 
New York and Chicago Districts. The outlook for retail spending was positive in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, while more cautious expectations were noted in the Boston, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts. 
Vehicle sales generally increased moderately across Districts. The New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts reported that sales remained strong or at high levels. Meanwhile, the Minneapolis District reported modest growth in auto sales, and contacts in the Kansas City District reported that sales declined. Used car sales increased in the Chicago and St. Louis Districts, while the Richmond District noted that the availability of used cars improved. Meanwhile, the New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts reported a shortage of used cars or a decline in used car sales. Inventories increased in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts, while inventories were lean in the Philadelphia District. More respondents to a St. Louis District survey indicated that inventories were too high than too low. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted that the outlook for future sales was generally positive. 
Tourism showed signs of strength in several Districts. The Boston District reported increased tourism revenues but noted that attendance at museums and attractions was down, perhaps due to weather affecting leisure travel plans. The New York District noted that tourism activity was mixed but fairly robust since the previous report. The Richmond District reported that unseasonably cool weather negatively affected some resorts. Leisure and international travel continued to experience healthy demand in the Atlanta District. Extended winter weather boosted skiing in parts of the Minneapolis District. The San Francisco District reported that travel and tourism activity in Hawaii was robust, while activity in southern California declined a bit. Hotel occupancy and room rates were higher in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts. Advanced bookings and the overall outlook for summer travel were optimistic, but the San Francisco District noted some concern that the flow of international visitors could taper off in coming months due to potential weakness in the global economy. Nonfinancial Services Nonfinancial services activity grew at a modest to moderate pace since the previous report. The Philadelphia District noted steady gains, while moderate growth was reported in the Minneapolis District. The San Francisco District saw flat demand for health care and legal services. The Boston District noted sluggish activity in information technology services, while the Kansas City District saw increased demand for high tech services. Information technology, distribution, business support, 
iv 
health care, engineering, and hospitality firms expanded in the St. Louis District. The Richmond District reported “renewed vigor,” especially for technology and architectural firms. The Dallas District saw strong demand for accounting services and modest increases in legal services. 
Transportation activity increased. The Cleveland District noted strong activity, while both import and export traffic increased in the Richmond District. The Atlanta District reported increased movement of petroleum products and wood products but decreased shipments of grain products, metallic ores, military machinery, and transportation equipment. The Dallas District saw increased cargo and container volumes. The Kansas City District reported slower transportation activity due to poor weather conditions. Minneapolis District contacts expected small increases in freight traffic in the second half of the year. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate and construction activity increased at a moderate to strong pace in all Districts. Several Districts reported that higher demand and low inventory of homes available for sale are resulting in multiple offers on properties. Almost all Districts reported higher home sale prices. The Kansas City District reported concerns that appraisals were not keeping pace with price increases. Foreclosed properties available for sale have declined significantly in the San Francisco District. The rental market remains tight with noticeable increases in rental rates in the New York District. Residential construction increased across all of the reporting Districts. Several Districts noted increases in multifamily projects. The Minneapolis District reported that many markets saw huge percentage increases in building permits from a year ago. Builders are cutting back on discounting in the Cleveland District. The Richmond District noted that increased construction has pushed up the price of building lots, and the Atlanta District reported that the lack of available lots has constrained building activity. The Philadelphia District commented that builders are facing problems, as the long housing recession has disrupted the supply chain for materials and the pool of skilled workers. 
Commercial real estate and construction activity expanded at a modest to moderate pace in most Districts. The New York District reported that the Manhattan market is particularly robust. The Chicago District noted that an increase in demand for leasing was pushing up commercial rents, with strong demand from the health care sector. However, a market in the Boston District indicated no change in commercial rents or vacancy rates since the previous report. A market in the Richmond District had more hotels complete construction, and retail space was absorbed at a faster pace. Commercial construction continues to expand. The Philadelphia District said that most construction 
v 
activity is related to ongoing demand for industrial warehouse space, higher education facilities, and public utility infrastructure. The Atlanta District reported that most activity was coming from build- to-suit projects. The Dallas District noted an increase in office building construction. The Cleveland District said that many projects are in development, but new inquiries are weak. The San Francisco District noted that in some regions, construction of publicly funded commercial projects has slowed due to funding constraints from state and local governments. 
Banking and Finance 
Overall bank lending increased modestly since the previous report. The Cleveland District noted that consumer demand for auto loans increased and that demand for residential loans shifted from refinancing to new purchases. The Chicago District indicated modest growth in business loan demand. The Dallas District reported robust growth in residential mortgages and auto lending with continued weakness in corporate transactions. The New York District saw an increase in demand for all types of loans except commercial and industrial loans, where demand was unchanged. San Francisco District banking contacts reported ample liquidity and competition among lenders for well- qualified business borrowers but limited credit availability for small businesses. The Philadelphia District noted slow loan growth, and the Atlanta District reported weak loan activity. 
Credit quality improved, on balance. The New York and Cleveland Districts reported widespread decreases in delinquency rates for business and consumer loans. Several Districts reported that credit standards have not changed much since the previous report. Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural conditions remained mixed across Districts, as weather patterns varied. Recent rains brought drought relief to the Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts but delayed or slowed plantings in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Meanwhile, drought conditions worsened in the Dallas District, and contacts in the San Francisco District remained concerned that limited water availability in parts of the District could pass through to lower seasonal hiring and reduced agricultural output in coming months. Farm incomes increased in the Minneapolis District, while farm income growth softened in the Kansas City District. Well over 90 percent of the St. Louis District’s winter wheat crop was rated in fair or better condition, but winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further in the Kansas City District, with much of the crop in relatively poor condition. Forage crops were having a great spring in the Richmond District, and pastures and hayfields were in good condition. 
vi 
Overall activity in the energy sector was flat, and mining was down. The San Francisco District saw decreased natural gas drilling. The Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noted that oil activity was flat and that natural gas activity was up. The Minneapolis District reported that the energy sector remained strong. The Dallas District said that drilling activity was up. Coal mining was down slightly in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts, while coal mining in the Kansas City District was steady. Iron ore mining production was down in the Minneapolis District. Employment, Wages, and Prices Hiring increased at a measured pace in several Districts, with some contacts noting difficulty finding qualified workers. Labor markets continued to improve in the New York District. The Boston District reported that with only a few exceptions, businesses were not hiring much beyond replacement, while labor markets in the Richmond District were uneven. Labor markets continued to improve slowly in the Chicago District. The St. Louis District reported that employment levels over the past three months have stayed the same or increased for a majority of contacts. Labor markets tightened in the Minneapolis District, particularly near the oil boom area in western North Dakota and eastern Montana, although some easing in the pace of growth was noted over the past six months. Labor markets were steady in the Dallas District. The New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts cited examples of contacts reporting difficulty finding qualified people to fill vacancies. The Richmond and Cleveland Districts noted that new hours of service regulations may exacerbate difficulty finding truck drivers. A number of Districts reported solid demand for workers in information technology, health care, and engineering. The Richmond and Atlanta Districts cited employment reductions due to cutbacks in government orders or staffing at government offices. Among staffing services firms, billable hours increased in the Philadelphia District but decreased in the Boston District. Meanwhile, staffing services were steady in the Dallas District and mixed in the Cleveland District. The outlook for hiring was generally positive in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. 
Wage pressures remained contained overall, though several Districts reported a modest or moderate rise for selected occupations. The Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts indicated that overall wage pressures were subdued. The Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts reported that wage pressures increased slightly, while reports were mixed in the Richmond District. The New York District noted that although qualified job candidates were said to be increasingly hard to find, most employers were holding the line on compensation. Exceptions 
vii 
included increased wages for home builders in the Philadelphia District, and legal and financial services in the Dallas District. Contacts in the Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts expressed concern over the effect of health care reform on labor costs. The Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts reported increased costs for health insurance. 
Districts reported level prices to mild price increases. The Boston District reported that aside from food, input prices were generally unchanged, although a few manufacturers have raised their own prices. Manufacturers in the Richmond District indicated that finished goods prices grew at a somewhat quicker pace. The Kansas City District reported that while finished goods prices remained fairly flat, manufacturers planned to raise finished good prices over the next few months to partially offset higher input costs. However, most firms in the Atlanta District continued to report having little pricing power, and the Chicago District noted that pass-through to downstream prices remained limited. The Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts reported higher construction materials prices. Meanwhile, the San Francisco District noted that prices for cement, logs, and lumber edged up, while prices for wood products, steel, and some metals declined. Gasoline prices spiked higher in the Minneapolis District, and several Districts noted that natural gas prices increased since the previous report. The Dallas District reported that most contacts expect price increases to remain modest for the remainder of the year.",1,1
2013-06-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest overall economic activity expanded at a moderate pace during the reporting period from late February to early April. Activity in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts was characterized as growing at a moderate pace, while the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts noted modest growth. The New York and Dallas Districts indicated that the pace of expansion accelerated slightly since the previous Beige Book. 
Most Districts noted increases in manufacturing activity since the previous report. Particular strength was seen in industries tied to residential construction and automobiles, while several Districts reported uncertainty or weakness in defense-related sectors. Consumer spending grew modestly, and firms in some Districts cited higher gasoline prices, expiration of the payroll tax cut, and winter weather as factors restraining sales growth. Retailers in several Districts expect continued sales growth in the near term. Overall vehicle sales remained strong or increased, but sales of used automobiles declined in some Districts. Travel and tourism expanded across most reporting Districts, boosted by both business and leisure travel. 
Demand for nonfinancial services increased at a modest pace, and several Districts noted growth in freight and transportation services. Most Districts said residential and commercial real estate improved markedly since the last report. Home prices were rising in many areas of the country. Loan demand was steady to slightly up in most Districts. Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed, as drought or cold weather adversely impacted some Districts while others reported a strong agricultural sector. Oil and natural gas activity remained robust over the reporting period, with contacts in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts expecting a rise in activity in coming months, while coal production continued to decline. 
Employment conditions remained unchanged or improved somewhat, and reports of hiring were most prevalent in the manufacturing, residential construction, information technology, and professional services sectors. Wage pressures were generally contained, although several Districts cited upward pressures in occupations experiencing labor shortages, such as information technology, construction, and engineering. Aside from reports of increases

ii 
in home prices and residential construction materials, price pressures remained mostly subdued across Districts. 
Outlooks among respondents remained optimistic across sectors and Districts, with growth mostly expected to continue at the same or a slightly improved pace. Some uncertainty remained, primarily regarding fiscal policy and health care reform. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity held steady or increased in most Districts since the previous Beige Book. The pace of growth picked up in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while the Richmond and Chicago Districts noted that the pace of growth in production was slower than earlier this year. Contacts in the Boston District reported mixed conditions, and manufacturing activity held steady in the New York District. Manufacturing conditions in the Kansas City District continued to soften, driven by weaker durable goods production, although factory managers project a rebound in coming months. Firms in the New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts were broadly optimistic about prospects for 2013, while cautious optimism was expressed by manufacturers in the Cleveland District, and mixed outlooks were expressed in the Boston District. Contacts in the Atlanta District do not expect future production to be as high as previously projected. 
Strength in residential construction spurred manufacturing increases in several Districts. There were widespread reports of growth in demand for wood products; a contact in the Philadelphia District noted the best growth prospects in five years, a sawmill in Montana restarted production after idling for more than four years, and a Dallas District lumber firm noted a seasonal demand increase for the first time in several years. The auto industry remained a source of strength for several Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Gains were reported by food manufacturers in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, and food contacts in the St. Louis and Dallas Districts plan to expand operations or make significant capital expenditures. In the Cleveland District, suppliers to the shale gas industry cited strong activity, and increased activity in natural-gas related industries was seen in the Chicago District. Electronic equipment and instruments manufacturers in the Philadelphia District and high tech firms in the Kansas City District noted gains over the reporting period, 
iii 
while reports on high tech orders in the Dallas District were mixed across customer groups, and semiconductor firms in the Boston District said sales continued to languish. 
Numerous Districts reported uncertainty or weakness in military or defense-related sectors. San Francisco District defense-related manufactures noted furloughs, layoffs, and plant closures at some production facilities, and military customers in the Chicago District were taking measures to lower costs in anticipation of tighter future defense budgets. Lower activity was indicated by makers of primary metals in the Philadelphia District, and Chicago District specialty metal manufacturers noted declines in new orders. Demand for steel was relatively flat in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, while firms in the San Francisco District saw an increase in demand for steel products used primarily in transportation infrastructure and nonresidential construction projects. Reports from fabricated metals producers were mixed across Districts, with increases noted in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts while weaker production was noted in the Kansas City District. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Most Districts reported increases in retail spending. Firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted sales increased at a modest to moderate pace. Most retailers in the Boston District said demand was slower than expected. Sales activity was mixed according to the Atlanta District’s report, and retail spending declined in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. Demand for apparel rose in the Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, and sales of furniture and appliances in the Chicago District were buoyed by improvements in the housing market. Sales of electronics rose in the Cleveland District, and the San Francisco District report indicated strong demand for mobile computing devices. Contacts in some Districts cited higher gasoline prices, expiration of the payroll tax cut, and winter weather as factors restraining sales growth. Looking ahead, retailers in several Districts expect modest sales growth in the near term. In particular, the St. Louis District reported new store openings, and some retailers in the Dallas District said they have added employees in line with expanding operations. 
Overall, automobile sales remained strong or increased moderately since the last report. The exception was a slight decline in sales of used vehicles in the New York and Cleveland Districts. A number of contacts in the St. Louis District reported plans to open new dealership 
iv 
locations, and dealers in the Chicago District were building inventories for the spring selling season. Used vehicle prices remained high. Outlooks were mostly positive, and contacts in the Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts expect sales to increase in coming months. However, some auto dealers in the Cleveland District expressed concern about the potential negative impact of fiscal policy on consumer spending. 
Reports from most Districts pointed to continued strength in travel and tourism, bolstered by both the business and leisure segments. Business travel remained robust in the Boston, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts, and foreign visitors continued to boost convention travel according to the Atlanta District. The Minneapolis District noted that winter tourism activity was stronger than last year, and spring-break related travel bolstered tourism in the Richmond District. Restaurants in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts noted increased sales. Bookings were strong at some resorts in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, and hotels in Manhattan, Hawaii, and the Kansas City District noted solid gains in occupancy rates. In contrast, business at restaurants and museums in the Boston District softened in part due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attendance and revenues were slightly lower at Broadway theaters, casino revenues fell in the Philadelphia District, and tourism activity weakened in Southern California during the reporting period. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Demand for nonfinancial services expanded at a modest pace since the previous report. The Kansas City and San Francisco Districts noted solid growth in information technology services, and contacts expect demand to remain robust through year-end. The Boston District reported strong demand for healthcare consulting services partly due to changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act, while healthcare firms in the San Francisco District indicated plans to freeze hiring and scale back capital expenditures in response to federal spending cuts. Defense- related and other firms dependent on the federal government in the Philadelphia District said they expect a decline in activity for the remainder of the year. 
Activity expanded for professional and business services, such as accounting, advertising, marketing, consulting, and legal services. Consulting services remained strong in the Boston District, and firms in the Dallas District noted strength in accounting services. Advertising and marketing firms in the Boston District said an uptick in growth for their services was buoyed by 
v 
stronger financial positions of clients. The St. Louis District noted plans for hiring and expansion in social and legal services, while the Dallas District report indicated weaker-than-expected growth in demand for legal services. 
Transportation service activity increased since the previous report. Air travel improved in the Dallas District, in part due to spring-break related activity. Intermodal cargo volumes moved higher in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, and activity at logistics and transport firms in the Philadelphia District grew at a moderate rate. Trucking traffic picked up in the Kansas City District, and trucking cargo volumes were above year ago levels according to Atlanta’s report. Railroad contacts in the Dallas District said shipments grew, particularly for petroleum and construction-related products, and freight transportation volumes were higher than expected in the Cleveland District. According to Richmond’s report, container traffic increased at larger ports in the District because of continued strength in shipments of auto parts. Air freight volumes rose in the Atlanta District, and small parcel shipments grew strongly in the Dallas District. However, railroad shipments were flat to slightly down in the Atlanta District, and a contact in the Richmond District said that European-bound vessels were leaving the port lighter than in the past, particularly due to a decline in construction and agricultural equipment exports. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate activity continued to improve in most Districts, and some Districts, including Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, noted increased momentum since the last report. The New York District, in particular, noted especially strong improvement in residential real estate—both in for-sale housing and apartment markets. 
Home sales continued to rise in most Districts. Although homebuyer demand was high in the Boston District, low home inventories were restraining sales, keeping growth modest. Home sales were reportedly strong in both the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. The Richmond District noted low inventories were pushing up contracts to well above listing prices, and the Boston and New York Districts said multiple bids on properties have become more common. Tight inventories and strong sales led to rising home prices in many Districts, including Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Within the New York District, condo sales volumes strengthened and low inventories have begun to drive up selling prices in New York 
vi 
City and surrounding areas, while New Jersey home prices were rising modestly and inventories were shrinking with a marked reduction in the number of distressed properties. Contacts in the Boston District also noted a decline in the stock of distressed properties. 
New home construction continued to pick up in most Districts, although the Richmond District said that a low supply of residential building materials had stalled construction. Only the Philadelphia District noted that residential construction decelerated somewhat, although home sales were still growing moderately. Multifamily construction increased in several Districts including Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. The New York District noted apartment rents accelerated in early 2013, due to stronger demand coupled with historically low inventories. The Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts said apartment demand remained strong. 
Commercial real estate and construction activity improved in most Districts. Office vacancy rates declined in the Boston District and contacts said the construction of mixed-use projects was picking up. The New York District reported that office vacancy rates continued to decline and rents rose in Manhattan. The Philadelphia District commented that there was not much change in nonresidential activity during the reporting period, but that contracts for repair work from Hurricane Sandy have yet to be approved. Contacts in the Richmond District cited a tight supply of class A office space and said there were several large projects under construction in the Washington D.C. area. Commercial construction saw widespread improvement with the New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts noting increases. Both commercial real estate development and leasing activity increased across the San Francisco District, mostly fueled by growth in the technology industry. Several Districts, including Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City said commercial property investment sales activity increased during the reporting period. 
Contacts in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts were somewhat optimistic in their outlooks for the commercial real estate and construction markets in general, but contacts in the Cleveland District were cautious about near-term construction activity. Dallas District contacts said office and warehouse markets were improving, and Atlanta District respondents noted growing optimism for the office and industrial sectors. 
vii 
Banking and Finance 
Loan demand was steady to slightly up at most District Banks that commented on lending. The Philadelphia District, however, said loan volumes softened somewhat since the previous report. The New York District noted widespread increases in loan demand, particularly for commercial loans and residential mortgages, and the Cleveland District said business and consumer loan demand picked up since the last report. The Dallas District saw broad-based improvement in loan demand as energy-related lending remained strong and commercial real estate and home equity lending bounced up from low levels. The San Francisco District said increased growth in automobile and mortgage loans spurred overall improvements in loan demand. Several Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, said loan pricing was very competitive. 
Reports on mortgage lending were mostly favorable. Stronger refinancing activity was cited by the New York and Atlanta Districts. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts noted a shift from mortgage refinancing to new purchases, and the New York, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported an uptick in residential mortgage loans. 
Most District banks said credit conditions remained favorable, with improved credit quality for business and consumer loans. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural conditions were mixed across Districts, largely due to varying weather patterns. Drought persisted in the Kansas City District and worsened slightly in the Dallas District, straining the respective winter wheat crops and causing continued losses in the livestock sector. However, drought conditions improved significantly in much of the Atlanta District, and the winter wheat crop in the St. Louis District was largely in good condition. Cold weather delayed field preparation for spring planting in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. The Minneapolis District’s agricultural sector remained strong, and producers in the San Francisco District noted increased production as well as higher demand. Farmers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts plan to increase soybean acreage this year but were mixed in their plans for corn and other grain acreage. Contacts in the Chicago District noted that corn and soybean prices dropped over the reporting period based on expectations of a larger crop this year and current stocks not being as tight as anticipated. 
viii 
Oil and natural gas production generally held steady at moderate to high levels since the last report. Drilling activity was stable over the reporting period, but contacts in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts expect a rise in coming months. Output in some wet gas regions of the Cleveland District is expected to increase later in the year as new gas processing units come online. The energy sector was a bright spot in the Atlanta District, as projects to increase the Gulf Coast’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity drove capital and labor demand. Across the country, coal production continued to decline, with lower output reported by the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts. 
Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Labor market conditions remained unchanged or improved slightly, and reports of hiring were more widespread in the manufacturing, residential construction, information technology, and professional services sectors. Several Districts noted robust demand for workers tied to the residential construction sector, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco. In particular, a lumber and wood products firm in the Philadelphia District said the firming housing market had resulted in the best growth prospects in five years. Demand for information technology professionals and engineers was strong in the New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Staffing firms in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts noted an increase in orders from the manufacturing sector, and several manufacturers in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts said they planned on expanding their payrolls. Reports from the New York and Richmond Districts indicated strong demand for temporary workers. The Minneapolis District noted a tightening labor market, and along with the Dallas District cited continued challenges in attracting and retaining workers in areas close to oil-drilling regions. The Chicago District cited a stronger job market for new college graduates and more competition among employers to fill intern positions. Contacts in several Districts faced difficulties finding highly trained or skilled workers, especially in the information technology and engineering fields. In contrast, hiring activity was limited in the Boston and Cleveland Districts, demand for staffing services softened in the Dallas District, and some Districts, including Richmond and Atlanta, reported restrained hiring due to uncertainty over fiscal policy or healthcare reform. 
Overall upward wage pressures continued to be fairly modest. There were a few exceptions, however. Several Districts reported wage pressures in sectors experiencing labor 
ix 
shortages, such as information technology, construction, and engineering. The Kansas City District noted wage increases for commercial truck drivers, and the Richmond District reported widespread wage increases in the service sector. Rising healthcare costs were a concern among contacts in a few Districts, including Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago. 
The majority of Districts said overall price pressures remained minimal during the reporting period. Several Districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, said prices for some construction materials rose since the last report, but there were few reports of pass-through. 
Kansas City District contacts said price increases for raw materials used in manufacturing led to higher selling prices in some instances and retail prices edged up. New York District respondents noted some increased selling prices in the service sector, and the Atlanta District reported that contacts in the transportation sector were able to cover cost increases with fuel surcharges. The Atlanta and Dallas Districts said that cotton prices rose since the last report. 
Contacts in the Richmond District noted input and finished goods prices rose at a slower pace since the last report, and Chicago District contacts said commodity prices were down slightly.",1,0
2013-05-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity generally expanded at a modest to moderate pace since the previous Beige Book. Five Districts reported that economic growth was moderate in January and early February, and five Districts reported that activity expanded at a modest pace. The Boston District said the economy continued to expand slowly, and the Chicago District reported that economic activity grew at a slow pace. 
Most Districts reported expansion in consumer spending, although retail sales slowed in several Districts. Automobile sales were strong or solid most Districts, and tourism strengthened in a number of Districts. The demand for services was generally positive across Districts, most notably for technology and logistics firms. Transportation services activity was mixed among Districts, although the majority of contacts were optimistic about future activity. Manufacturing modestly improved in most regions, with several Districts reporting strong demand from the auto, food, and residential construction industries. Residential real estate markets strengthened in nearly all Districts and home prices rose amid falling inventories across much of the country. Commercial real estate activity was mixed or improved slightly in most Districts, and financing for commercial development remained widely available. Overall loan demand was stable or slightly higher across nearly all Districts, and several bankers noted stiff competition for qualified borrowers. Agricultural conditions varied across the country, with some areas continuing to suffer from drought while others reported considerable precipitation and improved

soil moisture levels. Districts reporting on energy activity indicated modest expansions in crude oil and natural gas exploration, while mining activity slowed. 
Price pressures remained modest, with the exception of increases in prices for certain raw materials and slightly higher retail prices in several Districts. Even with some input costs rising, most District contacts did not plan to increase selling prices. The majority of Districts reported modest improvements in labor market conditions, although hiring plans were limited in several Districts. Wage pressures were mostly limited, but some contacts reported upward pressure for skilled positions in certain industries due to worker shortages. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending expanded in most Districts, but several Districts reported mixed or lower activity among non-auto retailers. Sales strengthened in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, and retail sales were higher than a year ago in the Boston, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts. San Francisco reported modest growth in sales, Dallas noted flat to slightly higher sales activity, and New York said retail sales were strong in January but slowed in February primarily due to weather. The Chicago District said consumer spending increased at a slower rate, while Cleveland and Atlanta noted mixed sales activity. Kansas City said retail sales decreased since the previous survey period and were expected to remain flat in the months ahead. Many District contacts commented on the expired payroll tax holiday and the Affordable Care Act as having restrained sales growth. Many Districts noted rising gasoline prices and fiscal policy as having a negative effect on consumer sales, and contacts in the Boston, New York, and Minneapolis Districts said severe weather depressed sales somewhat. Contacts in several Districts reported a shift in sales activity from local malls to the Internet and indicated deep discounting among retailers was becoming increasingly common. San Francisco noted 
iii 
somewhat soft sales for traditional retail grocers, whose competition has increased from discount and online retailers. 
Most Districts reporting on auto sales noted solid or strong increases in sales, with the exception of mixed activity in the St. Louis District and a seasonal slowdown in the Dallas District. Cleveland auto dealers credited milder-than-normal weather and pent-up demand for the robust sales growth. New automobile sales remained solid in the San Francisco District, driven by demand to replace older vehicles and low financing rates. Chicago and Minneapolis contacts reported an increase in activity for auto service departments due to inclement weather. Auto dealers in the Philadelphia District attributed the strong sales in New Jersey to the continued effect of Hurricane Sandy. The New York District reported wholesale and retail auto credit conditions as positive, with one contact noting increasingly aggressive lenders. Most Districts’ contacts were cautiously optimistic about future auto sales. 
Tourism remained solid or advanced further in most Districts, spurred by increased snowfall during the winter ski season. Travel was reported as robust in the New York District, particularly in Manhattan, as well as at hotels in the outer boroughs that are still occupied by displaced residents, utility workers, insurance adjusters, and others due to Hurricane Sandy. A ski resort in Minnesota reported that lift ticket sales and lodging were well ahead of last year, although not close to historical records. Boston and Atlanta noted a strong increase in international visitors, especially from Europe. Philadelphia said tourist activity was solid in the Poconos’ ski resorts, but some revenues were lost when schools cancelled winter break to make up for missed days during Hurricane Sandy. Contacts in the Richmond District mentioned increased activity along the outer banks of North Carolina, and San Francisco reported solid growth of visitor counts and occupancy rates in Hawaii. 
iv 
Nonfinancial Services 
Nonfinancial services activity continued to grow at a modest pace since the previous Beige Book. St. Louis and San Francisco reported strong demand for technology, logistics, marketing and legal services. Logistics services were also an area of growth in the Philadelphia District, but growth was modest due to firms’ concerns about possible federal spending cuts. High-tech services increased in the Kansas City District, but growth was lackluster in the Boston District due in part to weak demand from Europe and Japan. Staffing services firms in the Boston and New York Districts saw improved conditions, but activity was mixed in the Dallas District. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City services contacts continued to be optimistic about growth in the coming months and in the second half of 2013. 
Transportation services activity was mixed. Shipping volume in the Cleveland District met or exceeded expectations, with increases driven by the energy sector, rerouting of container traffic, and residual effects from Hurricane Sandy. Transportation activity also increased in the Atlanta District, and port contacts continued to invest in infrastructure and equipment improvements. Kansas City transportation services activity was flat compared to the previous survey period. Dallas reported weakened transportation demand, with decreases in intermodal cargo, air cargo, and coal shipments, but contacts noted that petroleum and petroleum-product shipments increased during the survey period. Trucking firms in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts had trouble finding experienced drivers, and a Cleveland contact said there may be a driver shortage in the summer. Expectations for future transportation activity were generally positive in most Districts. 
v 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing conditions improved in nearly all Districts, but the increases were generally modest. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco reported some increases in factory activity, but the majority noted that the pace of recovery was slow. Conditions were mixed in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, and manufacturing activity in the Kansas City District weakened. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts cited concerns over government regulation and fiscal uncertainty as a reason for slow growth. 
Auto production increased in the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, and a Minneapolis contact noted that production increased faster than expected, spurring plans to renovate their plant. Philadelphia and Dallas reported that food manufacturing activity also exceeded expectations during the current period. Manufacturing related to residential construction was a source of strength for many Districts, including wood product manufacturing in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts; household goods manufacturing in the Chicago District; cement manufacturing in the Dallas District; and general housing construction product manufacturing in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Boston Districts. Primary and fabricated metal manufacturers in the Philadelphia District experienced a slowdown in activity, and a structural steel manufacturer in the Minneapolis District planned to close. Durable manufacturing was weak in the Kansas City District, but non-durables–especially chemical manufacturing–improved. Expectations for future factory activity were generally more optimistic compared with the previous survey. Contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts expected activity to improve over the next few months across a wide variety of industries. 
vi 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate activity continued to strengthen in most Districts, although the pace of growth varied. Contacts in the Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted strong growth in home sales, while New York and Chicago reported slight improvements. A realtor in the Richmond District indicated that low interest rates continued to motivate home buyers, and potential buyers in the Philadelphia District expressed greater confidence, including entry-level purchasers who had been increasingly opting to rent since mid-summer. Contacts in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts said sales were higher than a year ago. Home construction increased in most Districts, with the exception of the Kansas City District where it was reported as unchanged. Several Districts noted ongoing strength in multifamily construction, although contacts in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts mentioned continued financing difficulties for builders. Home prices edged higher in the majority of Districts, with lower inventories generally cited as the primary cause. Richmond and Atlanta Realtors observed multiple offers on many homes. Philadelphia real estate contacts continued to report low-end home prices as firm or rising slightly, while high-end home prices were still falling. Inventories declined in nearly all Districts, with Realtors in several Districts concerned about the impact on future sales volume. 
Overall commercial real estate conditions were mixed or slightly improved in most Districts. Commercial real estate activity grew modestly in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts, and activity in the San Francisco District expanded. Boston and New York reported mixed activity, while the Kansas City and Dallas Districts noted few changes. Although some modest growth was reported in the Chicago District, the level of activity remained weak, and commercial contractors in the Cleveland District noted a slowing in activity, 
vii 
particularly for defense-related projects. Office vacancy rates declined across most of the New York District, and industrial vacancy rates in upstate New York posted their lowest levels in three years. Richmond contacts described the supply of Class A office space as tight, which they attributed to the absence of new construction. Commercial development and leasing activity increased in the San Francisco Bay and Seattle markets, fueled by sustained growth in the technology sector. Commercial construction improved by varying degrees in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Respondents in the Boston District expressed concerns about overbuilding in Boston’s apartment market and office sector, while Philadelphia contacts noted an increase in energy-related projects and repair work resulting from Hurricane Sandy. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago reported high demand for manufacturing space, with some Chicago manufacturers leasing temporary space to accommodate increased demand. Credit for commercial development and transactions was widely available, although Boston noted a large decline in loan demand and contacts in the Cleveland District said financing difficulties continued. 
Banking and Finance 
Loan demand was steady or increased across all the Districts that reported. Residential real estate loan demand was strong in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Chicago Districts, mainly driven by refinances due to continued low interest rates. Demand for commercial real estate loans was also strong in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts. Auto lending increased in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, and Philadelphia and Dallas cited growth in energy-related loan demand. San Francisco continued to report a slowdown in venture capital and private equity activity, but contacts noted an increase in the number of private technology companies moving toward an IPO. 
viii 
Asset quality improved at banks in the Philadelphia, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta and San Francisco lenders reported high competition for qualified borrowers. Borrowing standards were reported to have been loosened in some Districts. Atlanta contacts noted additional loan capacity, but continued to be cautious with loan activity. Cleveland bankers considered cost cutting measures, including layoffs, due to shrinking net interest margins. New York contacts indicated a decrease in loan spreads for all loan categories, particularly residential mortgages, and bankers in the Chicago District said that very few mortgage originations were being kept on their balance sheets and that interest rate swaps were being utilized to hedge against a potential rise in interest rates. Bankers were generally optimistic about future activity in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts for the near term, but Atlanta bankers expected activity to ease toward the middle of the year. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural conditions across the country varied with weather patterns. Persistent drought contributed to poor crop and pasture conditions in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts while recent precipitation improved soil moisture levels in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported that elevated crop prices supported stronger farm incomes. Kansas City and Dallas indicated that drought-related herd reductions pushed cattle supplies to historical lows, and Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas reported weaker agricultural export activity. Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted additional farmland value gains due to robust demand from both farmers and nonfarm investors. Chicago reported that congestion issues in barge traffic eased on the Mississippi River. 
Energy activity remained mixed with modest expansions in crude oil and natural gas exploration but slower mining activity. Drilling activity for crude oil and natural gas expanded 
ix 
further in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts and was steady in the Richmond and Dallas Districts. Future drilling activity was expected to rise in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, and Atlanta noted capital spending at Gulf of Mexico ports was expected to increase export capacity for oil refineries. In contrast, coal production fell in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts, and was expected to decline further with a shift in demand toward low-priced natural gas and stricter environmental regulations. Minneapolis reported a slowdown in metal mining activity, and some facilities planned to further reduce production later in the year. Ethanol production declined in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts but edged up in the Chicago District. 
Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Labor market conditions generally improved, although several Districts reported restrained hiring. Many Districts reported a rise in temporary employees, while staffing contacts in the Boston District noted an increase in the placement of permanent and temporary-to- permanent workers. Auto dealers in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts mentioned plans to hire more workers, and Dallas noted robust hiring activity for experienced corporate, energy, and intellectual property lawyers. Positions in the manufacturing industry increased in the New York, Richmond, and Chicago Districts, although several Chicago manufacturers expressed plans to either invest in more productive capital or adjust the hours of existing employees prior to hiring new workers. St. Louis noted weakness in healthcare services and information technology positions, and Cleveland reported reduced hiring plans from commercial builders and coal operators. Employers in several Districts cited the unknown effects of the Affordable Care Act as reasons for planned layoffs and reluctance to hire more staff. Wage pressures were minimal in most Districts, but contacts reported some upward pressure for several skilled positions as a 
x 
result of higher demand. Some Districts indicated a shortage of skilled workers such as engineers, truck drivers, software developers, and technical jobs, and Atlanta noted a lack of compliance specialists due to heavier regulations in the healthcare industry. 
The majority of Districts reported that price pressures remained modest, but some input costs continued to rise. Cleveland and San Francisco noted an increase in prices for petroleum- based products such as gasoline, fertilizer and certain plastics, and contacts in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts commented on increased transportation and fuel costs. Builders in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts cited an increase in construction material costs, particularly for lumber, drywall, and steel. Retail prices were steady or slightly rising in most Districts, although Richmond noted some slowing since the last report. Chicago retailers reported modest wholesale price increases for a number of products, with larger increases for meat, fresh produce, and leather. Retail grocers in the San Francisco District reported relatively stable prices overall, but weather-related factors boosted fresh produce prices. Increased food costs pushed up restaurant menu prices in the Kansas City District, and restaurant owners expect these costs to remain elevated. Atlanta service industry contacts noted that stronger sales were likely to put upward pressure on prices over the next year. Plans to increase selling prices were limited among most District contacts.",1,1
2013-03-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity has expanded since the previous Beige Book report, with all twelve Districts characterizing the pace of growth as either modest or moderate. Since the previous Beige Book, activity in the New York and Philadelphia Districts rebounded from the immediate impacts of Hurricane Sandy. Growth in the Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts appears to have increased slightly, while the St. Louis District reports some slowing. 
All twelve districts reported some growth in consumer spending. Overall, holiday sales were reported as being modestly higher than in 2011, though sales were below expectations for contacts in many of the Districts. Auto sales were reported as steady or stronger in ten Districts. Citing concerns that consumers will spend cautiously due to ongoing fiscal uncertainty, retail contacts and auto dealers reported a slightly dimmer, though positive, outlook for future sales. Tourism activity was reported to have increased across much of the nation due to strong business and international travel, early snowfall in some ski areas, and a rebound in areas disrupted by Hurricane Sandy. 
Activity among nonfinancial service sectors improved overall. Firms within the six Districts reporting on transportation services generally noted increased volumes. Manufacturing was mixed overall since the previous Beige Book; six Districts reported an expansion of activity and three reported a decrease. Among Districts reporting on their firms’ near-term expectations, the manufacturing outlook remained generally optimistic; however, capital spending plans were less uniformly positive.

i 
Since the previous Beige Book, real estate activity has expanded or held steady in eleven Districts for existing home sales and leasing; eight Districts for residential construction; eleven Districts for nonresidential sales and leasing; and nine Districts for nonresidential construction. Overall loan demand was steady in five Districts, rose in four, and fell in one. Credit standards were largely unchanged, except in two Districts where there were some signs of loosening. Six Districts reported improving credit quality and/or falling delinquency rates. 
Although rain partially eased drought conditions for some agricultural regions in three Districts, reports of agricultural activity remained mixed. Districts reported that energy and mining sector activity was steady at high levels for most energy-related products but significantly weaker in coal production and coal-related investments. 
Trends in wages, prices, and employment conditions were relatively unchanged in the Federal Reserve Districts. Input price pressures were reported to be steady overall with mixed reports for specific commodity prices in various Districts. Employment conditions were also little changed since the last report. However, hiring plans were more cautious for firms doing business in Europe or in the defense sector. Wage pressures were stable in all twelve Districts, though several Districts cited greater pressures for firms that reported difficulties finding qualified workers with specific skills. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Since the previous Beige Book, consumer spending increased to some degree in all twelve Districts. Across the nation, holiday sales grew modestly compared with last year but came in below expectations in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Boston reported continued strong demand for clothing, shoes, 
ii 
and furniture, and San Francisco reported robust online sales. A major retail chain in New York indicated that sales picked up in early January. Retail sales were flat in Richmond except for gains in food and auto sales. Expectations for future sales were positive but mild, particularly in Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas where contacts cited the impact of fiscal cliff uncertainty on consumer spending. 
Reports of auto sales were steady to stronger in ten Districts. Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco noted strong sales. New York and Dallas cited mixed sales that were generally positive, while auto sales in Kansas City slowed but remained higher than a year ago. Some dealers in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts reported high levels of inventory. Contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas expect consumers to react to ongoing fiscal uncertainty, thus dimming a positive outlook for future sales. Chicago auto dealers were more upbeat, expecting stronger new car sales due to pent-up consumer demand, easing credit conditions, and rising used vehicle prices. 
Tourism held steady or grew in all but one of eight reporting Districts. Coastal activity had fallen in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy throughout most of the New York and Philadelphia Districts but has rebounded in all but the hardest hit areas. Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported strong tourism in their Districts, with Boston and Atlanta citing business and international travel as strong contributors. Winter tourism activity in the Minneapolis District was strong in areas with snow, while Richmond reported normal winter activity in its District. Nonfinancial Services 
Overall, nonfinancial services have grown modestly since the previous Beige Book. Businesses in the New York and Philadelphia Districts recovered from the 
iii 
disruption of Hurricane Sandy. The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported positive growth among various service sectors, while the Richmond District reported stable to stronger demand for service firms. Boston reported strong demand for some health-care IT services and drug impact research, while San Francisco noted relatively weak demand for health-care services. Staffing firms in the Dallas District reported steady to slightly softened demand. Respondents remained optimistic about growth over the near-term in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. 
Transportation services were generally positive among the six Districts that reported. Freight transport shipping volume improved in the Cleveland District due to rising demand from the retail sector and areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Atlanta reported increases in trucking tonnage and total railroad carloads, but low river levels caused delays in Mississippi River traffic. Reports from transportation services in the Dallas District were mixed, and most firms expect weak growth in the near-term. Trucking firms in the Richmond District reported a flattening in revenues; however, the District’s port activity was boosted by ships diverted by Hurricane Sandy. Manufacturing 
Reports of manufacturing activity were mixed overall, with six Districts growing since the last Beige Book, three Distracts contracting, and two Districts reporting little or no change. Firms in the Boston and Chicago Districts reported continued expansion of activity at modest and moderate rates of growth, respectively. Overall activity once again appeared to expand in the San Francisco District, although it was mixed across sectors. Gains in the aerospace and chemical sectors contributed to growth in the Boston and San 
iv 
Francisco Districts, as well as in the Dallas District. Manufacturing in the Chicago District grew with contributions from the auto and housing-related sectors. Manufacturing continued to expand, but at a more modest pace, in the Richmond District. Several firms cited falling export demand, especially from Europe. 
In contrast to slight declines in the past Beige Book, firms in the Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts reported slightly increased manufacturing activity. As in other Districts, product flowing into supply channels for auto production and housing construction contributed to Philadelphia’s gains. Prior trends continued as firms in the New York District experienced little or no growth, except for the revenues of firms in the New York City area that recovered after Hurricane Sandy disruptions. Reports continued to be mixed among sectors in the Dallas District. 
Manufacturing activity within the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, and reported plans in the St. Louis District, declined somewhat – a trend reversal from the prior Beige Book. Contributing to the declines were steel and auto producers in Cleveland and makers of HVAC equipment, electric components, food, and automobile parts in St. Louis. Despite production gains in electrical equipment, appliances, and components, more pronounced contractions within the broad nondurable goods sector led to a continuation of declining activity in the Kansas City District. 
Manufacturing firms’ expectations of future activity were generally optimistic in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts; the level of optimism has significantly increased in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts since the previous Beige Book. Contacts in the Chicago District expect vehicle production to expand in 2013, while reports of activity from manufacturers in the St. Louis District 
v 
have been negative on net. Boston District firms reported that capital spending was slow, except for select growth sectors. Capital spending was on track in the Cleveland District and was slowly increasing in the Chicago District. Looking ahead, Philadelphia District firms have significantly increased their capital spending plans, while the outlook in the Minneapolis District was reported as flat. In the Cleveland District, more contacts plan to reduce outlays than expand capacity. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Existing residential real estate activity expanded in all Districts that reported; growth rates were described as moderate or strong in nine Districts. Contacts in the Boston District attributed their strong sales growth to low interest rates, affordable prices, and rising rents. All Districts reporting on price levels saw increases; New York and Chicago reported only very minor increases. The five Districts that reported on housing inventories all reported falling levels. New residential construction (including repairs) expanded in all but one District of those Districts that reported. Contacts in the Kansas City District reported that increased lumber and drywall costs limited construction, causing a slight decline this period. Hurricane Sandy disrupted construction activity initially in New York, but this has since led to increased work for subcontractors on repairs and reconstruction. 
Though a little weaker than residential real estate, reports on sales and leasing of nonresidential real estate are still mostly positive – described as modest on average. The Boston District reported a drop in leasing beyond normal seasonal trends; contacts cited fiscal cliff uncertainty as a factor. Minneapolis and Kansas City reported increased demand and tightening commercial real estate markets. Philadelphia, St. Louis, and 
vi 
Dallas all reported more modest increases in nonresidential real estate activity. Nonresidential construction is weaker than residential, with only slight to modest growth. The Boston District reported that demand for commercial real estate loans appears to be softening and that the pipeline for new construction projects has diminished significantly since the last report. Dallas reported that construction was expected to pick up in the commercial real estate sector in 2013. Banking and Finance 
Overall, loan demand was largely unchanged in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, with most of these Districts reporting a continuation of slight to moderate growth in total volume. The New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported stronger demand than previously, while the St. Louis District reported a slight decline. Some increased lending in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas was driven by businesses taking out loans for special year-end purposes such as tax planning and dividend payments. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported strong auto lending. Demand for residential mortgages improved in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Commercial real estate lending was cited as a particular bright spot by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, lenders in San Francisco remained reluctant to lend to real estate investors outside of the multifamily residential sector. San Francisco also reported a slight slowdown in IPO, venture capital, and private equity activity in that District’s technology sector. 
Banks in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported improvements in asset quality. Lenders were described as 
vii 
competing aggressively for highly qualified borrowers in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco. In Atlanta, this stiff competition may be leading to loosening credit standards, as there was some indication that banks were more willing to increase their tolerance for risk. Chicago banks also reported some loosening of standards. On the other hand, lending standards remained largely unchanged in New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Reports of agricultural activity were mixed, although rain and mild temperatures delivered some relief from drought conditions to parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. Low water levels along the Mississippi River also hampered transport for some contacts in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Despite the drought, some contacts in these Districts reported that farm income remained high with adequate crop insurance and historically high prices. Producers in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts expect ongoing dry conditions to hurt the winter wheat crop. 
Activity in the energy sector had mixed reports. Production of oil and natural gas held steady at high – sometimes record – levels in the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reported that activity expanded to historic levels. Contacts in the Cleveland District reported that shale gas activity grew at a robust pace. In contrast, coal production has declined in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts since the previous Beige Book. Firms in the Atlanta District continue to plan investments, ranging from reserve development to increased refining and petrochemical operations to new pipeline infrastructure. 
viii 
Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Labor market conditions remained mostly unchanged in all Districts. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all reported delayed hiring, often in defense manufacturing, due to fiscal cliff uncertainties. Companies in the Chicago District with trade or investment exposures to Europe reduced their hiring plans as well. Chicago reported that manufacturers are choosing to cut hours instead of reducing head count in expectation of production rebounds in 2013. Atlanta and Kansas City cited health-care policy changes and costs as another cause for minimal hiring. On the other hand, the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts saw the labor market firming modestly. Finally, contacts in several Districts reported difficulties finding qualified workers in some specialized fields, such as skilled manufacturing, energy, and IT. 
For those Districts that reported, wage pressures have been stable since the previous Beige Book and were most frequently described as contained or subdued. The San Francisco District reported modest wage pressures that were held down by an abundance of workers. The Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts characterized wage growth as moderate. Specifically, business contacts in the Minneapolis District expected to increase wages 2 to 3 percent in 2013, while oil drilling companies in North Dakota and Montana expected higher increases. Several Districts reported wage pressures in sectors experiencing labor shortages, such as energy and IT. The New York and Chicago Districts reported higher year-end bonuses ahead of anticipated tax increases in 2013. 
ix 
Overall, input price pressures appear to be stable. The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported steady input prices, while Chicago reported decreasing raw materials prices. The New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts characterized input prices as slightly increasing; price pressures in these Districts were passed through to consumers somewhat in the form of higher finished goods prices. However, Chicago noted that businesses were unable to fully pass on meat and milk price increases to consumers. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all cited rising prices for construction- related materials. Specifically, a Philadelphia builder noted that over the past 90 days these rising prices added about 3 percent to the cost of a new home.",0,1
2012-11-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity generally expanded modestly since the last report. The New York District noted a leveling off in economic activity, and Kansas City indicated some slowing in the pace of growth. In general, other Districts reported that growth continued at a modest pace. 
Consumer spending was generally reported to be flat to up slightly since the last report. A number of Districts characterized retail sales as expanding at a modest pace, while reports from New York, Chicago, and Kansas City indicated flat or softening sales. Vehicle sales were also generally characterized as stable but up from a year earlier and generally at favorable levels. Used car sales were mixed. Most Districts described tourism as fairly robust, though Kansas City noted some general softening, while New York and Dallas indicated some scattered signs of weakening. 
Residential real estate conditions improved since the last report. Most Districts reported strengthening in existing home sales, while prices were described as steady to increasing, with declining inventories noted in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Residential construction was also described as rising in most Districts. Commercial real estate markets were mixed since the last report. Office markets showed signs of softening in the northeastern Districts—Boston, New York, and Philadelphia—while most other Districts reported stable or mixed market conditions. Industrial markets showed some strength in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta Districts, while softer conditions were noted in Richmond.

ii 
Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed but, on balance, somewhat improved since the last report. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported some expansion in activity, whereas New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported some weakening in activity. The nonfinancial services sector showed modest improvement in the latest reporting period. Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported some expansion in activity, while New York and Philadelphia indicated steady or mixed conditions. 
Overall loan demand was steady to stronger in most Districts. Credit standards were little changed since the last report, and a number of Districts noted improvements in loan quality or steady to declining delinquency rates. Agricultural conditions were mixed, with drought conditions continuing to adversely affect much of the mid-section of the nation. Activity in the energy sector remained robust. 
Districts mostly reported little change in prices of both finished goods and inputs. Prices for agricultural commodities and petroleum-based products were generally reported to be higher, while natural gas prices were said to be low or declining. Employment conditions were little changed since the last report. Several Districts continued to report shortages of highly skilled workers, but otherwise wage pressures remained modest. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago noted increases in the costs of employee medical benefits. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending was mixed but generally reported to be flat to up slightly over the latest reporting period. Retail sales were said to have improved modestly in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, while sales were characterized as flat to softer in the New York and Kansas City Districts. In general, retail sales were 
iii 
reported to be running only modestly ahead of a year ago. A number of reports noted various factors affecting sales, such as rising gasoline prices, political uncertainty, concerns about the “fiscal cliff” and weather. Atlanta and San Francisco noted that discounters have been outperforming traditional department stores. Cleveland reported that back-to-school merchandise sold well, while Chicago said that such sales were below expectations. Boston noted a pickup in furniture sales, Richmond cited brisk sales at building supplies stores, and San Francisco reported stronger demand at restaurants and food-service establishments. 
Vehicle sales were mixed but generally at favorable levels. Sales of new vehicles were steady to stronger and running ahead of comparable 2011 levels. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco described sales as strong, while New York and Chicago reported some moderation in sales in September, after a fairly strong August. Kansas City and Dallas reported some softening or leveling off in sales. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts noted that crossover SUVs have been selling well relative to less fuel-efficient vehicles. Sales of used vehicles were mixed, with San Francisco describing them as robust but New York and Cleveland characterizing them as flat. 
Tourism was generally described as steady at robust levels, though there have been scattered indications of some softening. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco described tourism as strong, whereas the Kansas City and Dallas Districts indicated some signs of weakening. Even Districts reporting strength noted some pockets of softening: Boston reported a small drop in advance bookings, New York indicated a dip in activity in mid-September, Richmond noted a significant drop in government-sponsored bookings, and Atlanta mentioned disappointing cruise bookings and on-board spending. The Dallas District noted weakening travel demand from Europe and 
iv 
Asia; Atlanta also indicated weakening traffic from Europe but added that Canadian and Latin American visitors largely picked up the slack. Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate showed widespread improvement since the last report. All twelve Districts reported that existing home sales strengthened, in some cases substantially. Selling prices were steady or rising. Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco noted declining or tight inventories, which have put upward pressure on prices. Modest price increases were reported in the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. New York and Richmond reported relatively strong demand at the high and low ends of the market, whereas Philadelphia and Kansas City noted relative strength for mid-range homes; Boston indicated a shift in the mix toward lower or medium priced homes. New home construction and sales were more mixed but still mostly improved: increased construction and/or new home sales were reported in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Multi-family construction, in particular, was described as robust in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Residential rental markets continued to be characterized as strong, even in the New York and Atlanta Districts where rents increased somewhat less strongly than in recent months. 
Commercial real estate markets were mixed since the last report. Office markets showed signs of softening in the northeastern Districts—Boston, New York and Philadelphia—with New York remarking on substantial new supply coming on the market in early 2013. In contrast, Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco noted some improvement, while most other Districts reported stable or mixed market conditions. Industrial markets showed some strength in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, while 
v 
conditions were described as sluggish in Richmond and mixed in St. Louis. Atlanta noted weakness in the market for retail space. Commercial construction activity was also mixed: Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City reported some improvement in non-residential construction activity, while Richmond and Dallas noted that activity was sluggish. Manufacturing 
Conditions in the manufacturing sector were mixed since the last report, though on balance, more Districts reported that conditions had improved than worsened. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported that activity expanded, though growth was generally seen as modest. Activity was reported as mixed in the Dallas District, while the New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts reported that activity weakened, though declines were mild for the latter two. Significant gains in manufacturing related to the construction, energy, and transportation sectors were reported across several Districts, with particularly robust gains tied to the automotive industry. There were exceptions in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts where manufacturing related to transportation equipment was reported as mixed. 
Steel production was said to be flat in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts, and lower in the St. Louis District. Activity related to machinery and equipment was reported as lower in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Weaker sales growth in the high tech industry was reported by Dallas, and Kansas City said that growth among high-tech firms remained sluggish in its District. The Boston District noted some weakness in the semiconductor industry, while the San Francisco District said that new orders from the semiconductor industry had improved. Manufacturing contacts in the St. Louis District were 
vi 
tentative about the outlook for 2013, and contacts in the Dallas District noted some uncertainty about the outlook due to the upcoming election. Nonfinancial Services 
Activity in nonfinancial services was stable to slightly stronger since the last report. The Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that service-sector activity expanded, while such activity was reported as steady in the New York District and mixed in the Philadelphia District. Richmond noted that business activity strengthened for professional, scientific, and technical service firms, and Dallas noted strength in energy, accounting, and audit-related services. There was an increase in activity for a wide range of consulting services in the Boston and Minneapolis Districts. Activity related to health care was reported to be stable in the San Francisco District, but increased significantly in the Boston District. San Francisco reported continued sales growth for a wide variety of technology services, and noted that demand picked up for restaurants and other food-service providers. 
Reports on goods transportation services generally remained positive. A pick up in such activity was noted in Cleveland, Atlanta, Richmond, and Dallas, while such activity was said to be flat in Kansas City. Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts reported strong shipments of automotive, construction, and energy-related products. Port activity expanded to record levels in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts. Air cargo volume increased in the Atlanta District, but declined in the Dallas District due to weakness in the international sector. 
Banking and Finance 
vii 
Overall loan demand increased slightly on net since the last Beige Book report. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported stronger loan demand on balance, while Kansas City and Dallas reported flat demand and Chicago reported somewhat weaker demand. Most Districts reported an increase in mortgage lending, especially for refinancing purposes. New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported some increase in demand for commercial and industrial loans, while demand for business loans was weak in Chicago and Dallas, and was characterized as mixed in Richmond. Demand for consumer credit, particularly for auto loans, was said to be strong in the Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while consumer loan demand was more limited in New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City. 
Credit standards were little changed since the last report. However, New York noted some tightening for consumer loans and residential mortgages, while Richmond and Chicago reported some easing for commercial and industrial loans. Still, loans remained difficult to obtain for many small businesses in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. Banking contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported stiff competition among lenders. Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas noted general improvements in loan quality, and delinquency rates generally held steady or declined in the New York, Cleveland, and Dallas Districts. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agriculture conditions were mixed since the last report. Drought conditions continued to hurt the agriculture sector in the Chicago District, parts of the Minneapolis District, and 
viii 
the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. However, agriculture activity was reported as higher in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, as well as in parts of the Minneapolis District, and was reported as stable in the San Francisco District. The Chicago and Dallas Districts noted that increased rainfall had improved crop conditions. In the Dallas District, crops were reported to be mostly in fair to good shape, with production levels ahead of last year but below average due to ongoing dry conditions. Producers in the St. Louis District reported that crops were generally in better condition than at the time of the previous report, and harvest rates for corn and rice were well ahead of their five-year averages. Contacts in the Atlanta District reported that the rise in some crop prices related to the drought in the Midwest led to an increase in crop production in the Southeast. Higher feed prices continued to adversely affect livestock producers in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, though the Chicago District noted some easing in higher feed prices which provided a bit of relief. 
Activity in the energy sector remained strong, with the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reporting robust gains in activity. The Minneapolis District reported that oil production hit a new record high in North Dakota, and the Cleveland District reported that oil and natural gas production held steady. Natural gas exploration was reported as lower in the Kansas City District and in parts of the Minneapolis District. Coal producers in the Cleveland District reported declines in production. Employment, Wages and Prices 
Employment conditions were little changed since the last report. The Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts indicated that employment levels were flat or up slightly, with stagnant demand and uncertainty related to the upcoming presidential election, U.S. fiscal policy, and European debt issues cited by some as restraining hiring. The 
ix 
New York and Chicago Districts noted weaker labor market conditions, and conditions were described as mixed in Richmond. Firms in the St. Louis District reported an increase in hiring plans. Several Districts continued to report that employers were having difficulty filling highly skilled positions. In response, a few Districts noted that firms were starting to increase training programs to meet their staffing needs. 
Most Districts reported that wage pressures remained modest since the last report, though an increase in the cost of employee medical benefits was noted in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago. To the extent that wage increases were observed, they were concentrated among highly skilled workers in information technology, health care, professional services, and some of the skilled trades, according to reports from the Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. 
Price pressures were said to be contained as most Districts reported that both finished goods and input prices were little changed since the last report. Higher prices were cited by some Districts for agricultural commodities and petroleum-based products, although low or declining natural gas prices were reported in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Contacts in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted that drought conditions continued to result in higher feed prices. There were scattered reports of higher crop prices starting to show through to food prices at the consumer level. Atlanta reported an increase in corn and soybean prices, while Chicago and Kansas City reported that these prices declined somewhat. Slightly lower prices for some technology-related products were reported in the San Francisco District.",0,1
2012-10-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic activity continued to expand gradually in July and early August across most regions and sectors. Six Districts indicated the local economy continued to expand at a modest pace and another three cited moderate growth; among the latter, Chicago noted that the pace of growth had slowed from the prior period. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported slow growth in most sectors and declines in manufacturing, while Boston cited mixed reports from business contacts and some slowdown since the previous report. 
Most Districts indicated that retail activity, including auto sales, had increased since the last Beige Book report, although Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco noted the retail improvements were small. Atlanta said that retail growth had slowed, while Philadelphia indicated growth in retail sales was somewhat faster than in the previous report. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco recorded strong performance in tourism. Many Districts reported some softening in manufacturing, either a slowdown in the rate of growth or a decline in the level of sales, output, or orders; among those with declining shipments and orders, Philadelphia noted that the rate of decline was tempering. 
Districts mentioning nonfinancial services noted increased activity, although at a slowing pace in Boston, softening in New York, and “flattening” in Philadelphia; Kansas City reported that sales of high- tech services declined slightly. Several Districts cited declining demand for staffing services. According to District reports, bankers in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City saw increases in demand for most loan types in recent months; by contrast, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that loan demand was mixed, softening, or slightly weaker. 
Real estate markets were generally said to be improving. On the residential side, all 12 Districts cited increases in home sales, home prices, or housing construction. Reports on commercial real estate 
* Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before August 20, 2012. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials 
ii 
markets were also generally positive, although San Francisco noted stable demand, Boston indicated conditions were not much changed since the last report, and Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis said commercial real estate conditions were mixed. 
District reports indicated that energy and mining activity was generally high and increasing. However, Cleveland noted softening demand for coal, while Minneapolis and Kansas City had some energy sectors up and some down. The Midwest drought has reduced actual and expected farm output, especially cotton, soybean, and/or corn crops in the Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts. 
Most Districts reported that the selling prices of manufacturing and retail products were largely stable. By exception, several Districts noted concerns about rising agricultural commodity prices, and Richmond mentioned a small uptick in retail prices. Hiring was said to be modest across the Districts, and wage pressures were characterized as contained. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Most Districts reported that retail spending in July and early August was up compared with the previous Beige Book. New York and San Francisco noted strengthening sales compared with a softer May and June, although in San Francisco’s case, the rise was only “a bit further.” Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported stronger retail sales, while Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas all said that sales were up “slightly.” In the Atlanta District, most retail contacts reported slower sales, while Boston’s retail contacts provided a mixed assessment. The Atlanta and San Francisco reports noted that discount retailers performed better than traditional department stores, while the Chicago report attributed the pace of growth in consumer spending to heavy discounting by retailers clearing space for back-to-school items. Boston and Chicago reported continuing weakness in furniture sales; Boston also reported weak sales of electronics, but Chicago noted some improvement in this category. Adult clothing sold well in Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. The Atlanta District said that luxury goods merchants, while still largely positive, provided more mixed reports compared with earlier this year; Kansas City cited weaker sales for high-end jewelry. For the remainder of 2012, Boston retailers have mixed sales expectations, Philadelphia retailers are cautiously optimistic, and those in Atlanta are 
iii 
conservative; retail contacts in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas expect sales to rise through the end of the year. 
Automobile sales are up in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, flat in Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas, and a bit slower paced in Richmond and San Francisco; nonetheless, vehicle demand in the latter two Districts is still strong, especially for used cars. The New York District reported that new car sales are “particularly robust” and Kansas City cited a sharp increase in new vehicle sales. Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City indicated that car dealers in their Districts expected these strong automobile sales to continue, while the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts reported concerns that consumer uncertainty might depress vehicle sales in coming months. 
Respondents in the Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported that tourist industry performance remains strong. The Atlanta District mentioned that Florida contacts reported a drop in European travelers, but said this decline was offset by an increase in business from Central and South America. Contacts in Boston noted some concern that weakness in Europe could soften tourist activity and that rising gas prices could affect leisure travel. The San Francisco District reported that the pace of growth had slowed in Las Vegas and other areas. Manufacturing and Related Services 
The picture in manufacturing was mixed. The Boston, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts reported increasing demand and sales since the previous Beige Book, although the improvement was generally small and uneven, with two of these four Districts reporting that demand growth, while positive, was slowing. Six Districts reported that demand for manufactured goods was actually falling, although none reported a dramatic fall. The outlook was somewhat more positive, with six Districts reporting that manufacturers expected increasing demand and only two reporting the opposite. 
Areas of strength were varied. The Cleveland and Philadelphia Districts both pointed to the revolution in natural gas production in the United States as a driver of demand, but the Chicago District said that a contact blamed cheap natural gas for weakness in demand for coal. Several Districts noted that improvements in residential construction boosted demand for products such as lumber, PVC, cement, and 
iv 
home goods. The Chicago and Philadelphia Districts said that auto production was positive, but Richmond said the opposite. 
Weakness overseas remains a problem for U.S. manufacturing. Reports from the Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts explicitly mentioned it. Although Europe represented one notable problem, several Districts also mentioned weakness in demand in Asia as an issue. In general, District reports indicate that the cost and availability of raw materials has not been an issue for manufacturers recently, especially as compared with the situation in previous years. Four Districts reported lower input costs, but contacts in New York reported a slight increase. 
On the employment front, there was little movement. Across all Districts, few manufacturing firms reported any major hiring or layoffs, and the ones that did usually attributed it to idiosyncratic factors like new products or restructuring related to a merger. The Cleveland District reported that firms continued to have trouble finding skilled workers. Capital spending also showed little change; in addition, several Districts reported that contacted manufacturers had not revised their investment plans. Nonfinancial Services 
Activity in nonfinancial services generally picked up since the previous report, although results were mixed across Districts and service industries. New York and Philadelphia reported that overall service-sector activity was flat to down slightly, whereas Minneapolis and San Francisco noted expanding activity. Several Districts, including Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco, reported steady to increasing demand for information technology services; Kansas City, by contrast, cited decreased sales at high-tech services firms. Reports from the healthcare sector were also somewhat mixed, with Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting positive results and San Francisco noting a drop in the frequency of elective procedures. Advertisers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts continued to report strong revenues. In the Dallas District, legal firms reported continued increases in demand for services, while accounting firms cited seasonal slowness. Demand for staffing services was generally lower than expected, with decreases reported by Boston, New York, Richmond, and Dallas. Even so, demand remained strong for highly skilled IT personnel in the Boston and Richmond Districts. 
v 
Reports on transportation services were generally positive. Rail contacts reported continued increases in intermodal shipments in the Atlanta District and increased cargo volumes in the Dallas District, with both Districts recognizing gains in lumber shipments. Atlanta and Dallas also reported steady to increasing demand for trucking services, whereas logistics firms and carriers in the Philadelphia District reported a relatively sluggish start to the traditional “freight season.” Banking and Financial Services 
Credit conditions have improved over the reporting period according to District reports. Credit spreads were lower and competition for high-quality borrowers among lending institutions has increased. The New York District noted that shrinking spreads were observed particularly in commercial and industrial loans as well as in commercial mortgages. Some bankers in the Cleveland District mentioned a moderate loosening of lending guidelines. The New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts reported unchanged credit standards; New York and Cleveland cited declining delinquency rates. 
The direction and magnitude of changes in loan demand varied among the Districts and also with respect to type of loan. The Richmond and Atlanta Districts reported generally low demand for loans, but some pockets of growth. The Chicago District noted that growth in business loan demand was generated mostly from small and mid-size firms and for the purpose of refinancing rather than financing capital expenditures. Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco mentioned small positive or negative changes in business credit demand, and relatively strong demand for consumer credit. The Kansas City District reported stable demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans, while Dallas noted softer demand for loans overall; however, both Districts cited increases in demand for residential real estate loans. The New York and Philadelphia Districts observed growth in most lending categories. Real Estate and Construction 
Housing markets across most Districts exhibited signs of improvement, with sales and construction continuing to increase. Dallas reported significant levels of buyer traffic, Richmond noted strong pending sales, and Minneapolis and St. Louis mentioned increases in building permits. New York, 
vi 
Philadelphia, and Chicago indicated improvements as well, but characterized the progress as slow and modest. Declines in inventory levels were reported in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco; these declining inventories put some upward pressure on prices according to Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas. A reduction in the stock of distressed properties was mentioned in New York, Richmond, and San Francisco. In Philadelphia and Kansas City, the possibility of shadow inventory entering the market remains a concern. In general, outlooks were positive, with continued increases in activity expected, although the projected gains were more modest in Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City. 
Commercial real estate market conditions held steady or improved in nearly all Districts in recent weeks. New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City all reported that commercial leasing increased and vacancy rates fell. New York and Kansas City reported increases in office rents as well; Kansas City also cited a rise in commercial construction. Commercial building permits were up significantly from one year ago in portions of the Minneapolis District. Chicago’s report was mixed: office vacancy rates remained high, restraining demand for new office construction, but office leasing demand improved modestly and industrial construction picked up. Atlanta reported rising apartment rents and small gains in office leasing, with weakness in the retail and industrial sectors. Boston reported that office fundamentals were flat on average, with rising rents in portions of Boston proper and muted but steady activity elsewhere in the District. Nonresidential construction picked up in the Boston and Cleveland Districts. Office and industrial real estate markets remained healthy in Dallas. The St. Louis report noted an increase in commercial construction across much of the District and varied reports on leasing across areas within the District. In San Francisco, demand for commercial property was stable while commercial construction was limited. Richmond reported a decline in office leasing volume in Washington, D.C., but some portions of the District recorded increasing sales and construction. Multifamily real estate remained a strong submarket and a key driver of construction in many Districts, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. 
vii 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
According to District reports, agricultural conditions were mixed largely because of severe drought conditions that affected the Midwest more than the rest of the country. Producers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts were all severely affected by the drought, with cotton, soybean, and corn crops particularly damaged. Cotton production in the Dallas District was also badly damaged, while the northern part of the Minneapolis District reported good corn, soybean, and wheat crops, and the San Francisco and Richmond Districts reported strong demand for their healthy cotton crops. Although nearly all agricultural commodity prices rose, higher feed costs led to reduced herd sizes and lower livestock prices in nearly all Districts reporting on livestock. Reports from the Richmond and Kansas City Districts indicated that farmland values have continued to rise, although contacts in the Kansas City District expected them to hold steady for the rest of the year. Farm incomes generally rose or stayed the same in the Minneapolis District. 
Oil and gas activity continued to be robust across most Districts. Extraction of natural gas and petroleum remained at high levels in the Dallas and Minneapolis Districts and expanded in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts, partly because of increased demand from electrical utilities. Production increased in Gulf Coast oil refineries in the Atlanta District as a result of closures along the East Coast, while higher demand for crude oil, diesel, and other distillates supported prices. However, natural gas producers in the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported a decline in exploration and drilling of new wells on account of high inventories and low prices. Coal demand was unchanged from 2011 in the St. Louis District but was expected to fall below 2011 levels in the Cleveland District due to reduced demand for thermal coal from domestic utilities and metallurgical coal from Europe and Asia. Iron ore, taconite, and sand mines in the Minneapolis District continued to operate at high capacity. Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Most Districts reported that employment was holding steady or growing only slightly. Several Districts including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond noted a softening in employment relative to expectations; upcoming layoffs were reported by a defense contractor in the Boston District 
viii 
and by firms in sectors such as air transportation, appliances, and business support services in the St Louis District. Almost all Districts indicated that manufacturers were continuing to hire, albeit modestly. Demand has been strongest for skilled manufacturing and engineering positions, as well as for IT services. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts all reported some difficulty meeting demand for truck drivers. 
Overall, upward wage pressure was reported to be very contained across Districts. The Philadelphia and Chicago Districts both noted that despite little wage pressure, some contacts reported upward pressures for medical benefits. Sources from Boston and Atlanta mentioned that continuing demand was putting some upward pressure on wages for highly-skilled positions in software, engineering, and information technology. The San Francisco District also noted specialized IT positions as an exception to generally limited wage growth. The Dallas District reported upward wage pressure for truck drivers and construction workers, and the Minneapolis District noted wage increases in areas with increased oil drilling. 
Most Districts reported that overall prices for finished goods were relatively stable despite somewhat increased input prices. Higher prices for grain and other food commodities were cited by many Districts, primarily due to the drought. The Cleveland District noted increased upward pressure on lumber prices, while contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis reported higher gasoline prices as a potential concern. Chicago mentioned some pass-through of higher crop prices to wholesale prices, while contacts in the Kansas City and Richmond Districts expected to raise future prices in response to more expensive raw materials.",1,0
2012-08-31,"Reports from most of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that overall 
economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace in June and early July. The Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts reported modest growth, while Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas described economic activity as advancing moderately. The New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts noted that activity continued to expand, but at a slower pace since the last report, while Richmond cited mixed activity. 
Retail sales increased slightly in all reporting Districts except Boston and Cleveland, where sales were categorized as flat, and New York, where sales softened. Of the Districts that saw an increase in activity, most noted strength in auto sales. In particular, auto dealers noted that demand for fuel-efficient vehicles continued to support sales. Tourism activity remained strong according to contacts in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. 
All District housing market reports were largely positive as sales and construction levels increased and home inventories declined. Rental markets continued to strengthen with rising rents being reported in Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Commercial real estate leasing and construction continued to improve as demand for multifamily units increased in Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco. However, both New York and Richmond noted a slowdown in commercial activity, while Philadelphia and Dallas held steady. 
Manufacturing activity continued to expand slowly in most Districts, and Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City cited slight increases in production levels. However, several Districts reported a deceleration in new orders, and the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported declines in shipments and orders. Demand for nonfinancial services remained generally stable in most regions. Richmond noted strong sales among professional, scientific, and technical firms, while Dallas noted strength in energy, legal, and audit-related services. Transportation reports were generally positive, with Kansas City noting an uptick in trucking activity, while Richmond reported increased port activity.

ii 
Demand for loans, particularly those related to real estate, grew modestly in most Districts. However, both Cleveland and Richmond noted some weakness in loan activity. Credit standards remained unchanged in New York, Richmond, and Kansas City, while credit quality improved in Philadelphia, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Agricultural production and pricing reports were mixed. While drought conditions have affected production in some Districts, others noted favorable conditions. Chicago and Kansas City reported a significant deterioration of corn crops, which has pushed up prices since the end of June. 
All Districts conveyed that input prices had stabilized in recent months. Price pressures were described as easing in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco as energy costs declined. Wage pressures remained modest, except for highly skilled workers in information technology, health care, transportation, and manufacturing. Employment levels improved at a tepid pace for most Districts. Overall, Districts reported that their contacts remained cautiously optimistic about future business conditions. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Most Districts reported modest increases in retail spending on a year-over-year basis, but many reported slower growth in recent months compared with earlier in the year; however, Boston and Cleveland reported sales as flat, and New York cited softer sales. There were a few reports that high summer temperatures negatively affected sales. Sales of big-ticket household goods were strong in the Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while sales were reportedly flat for home furnishings and major appliances in the San Francisco District. Boston reported that sales for furniture and electronics had slowed, and retailers in the New York District reported that home goods sales were weak. Reports from luxury-goods retailers were mixed. Firms in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported that sales of high-end goods remained strong, while retailers in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts indicated demand had softened, and those in the Cleveland District noted that sales of luxury goods had slowed. Most Districts reported that vehicle sales remained robust. Demand was high for fuel- efficient vehicles in particular. Looking forward, merchants in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts were concerned that economic uncertainty could result in restrained sales growth, while retailers in the Cleveland District anticipated that the third quarter will be higher compared with year-ago levels. Kansas City noted that merchants there expected further strengthening in the coming months. 
iii 
Travel and tourism activity was reported as strong across several Districts. Hotel occupancy rates and revenue per room were robust in many areas according to reports from New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco. Attendance numbers were solid at attractions in various Districts, including theme parks in Florida and New York’s Broadway theaters. Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported that natural disasters had negatively affected bookings in some parts of their Districts. Dallas reported that demand for international travel was strongest for South America and Mexico destinations. Atlanta shared their contacts’ concerns about the potential impact of economic and financial stress abroad and the effect it could have on international travel. That said, several Districts reported that the outlook among the majority of hospitality contacts for the remainder of the summer is good as hotel and convention bookings continued to exceed last year’s pace. Real Estate and Construction 
Reports on residential housing markets remained largely positive. Sales were characterized as improving in Philadelphia, New York, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, while home sales increased in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, reports on sales were mixed in the New York District, and gains in the Boston District eased from earlier in the year. New home sales were described as disappointing in the Philadelphia District. Construction increased in the New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while reports from the Cleveland District said construction slowed. Most Districts reported declines in home inventories. Homes prices have begun to stabilize in some markets and price increases were noted in select markets. Boston and Atlanta noted that appraisals were coming in below market prices. 
Rental markets continued to strengthen by most accounts. Rising apartment rents were reported in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Strong demand for rental units spurred increases in multifamily construction in the San Francisco District. Multifamily construction was described as strong in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Apartment construction is expected to pick up over the next several months in the Dallas District. 
Recent activity in commercial real estate markets has been mixed. Modest improvements were noted in Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis and demand strengthened in the San Francisco District. Softer conditions were reported in the New York and Richmond Districts, while 
iv 
demand held steady in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts. Nonresidential construction activity varied as well. Construction activity increased modestly in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts, while construction continued to gain momentum in the Boston District. Demand for commercial construction rose in Chicago, while activity was described as much improved from a year earlier in the Cleveland District. Construction was flat in the Atlanta District on a year- over-year basis, while activity had softened in recent months in the Richmond District. Overall, the outlook among commercial real estate contacts and contractors was slightly positive. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing continued to expand in June and early July in most Districts, but at a more modest pace compared with earlier in the year. Several Districts reported that new orders had moderated since the last report, but the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts were more optimistic that new orders would rebound. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts however, reported declines in shipments and orders. The passing of a transportation bill through Congress led contacts in the Philadelphia District to express interest in increasing their capital spending. Capacity utilization rates at refineries and petrochemical manufacturing facilities held steady in the San Francisco District, with weaker domestic demand being offset by growing exports. Meanwhile, manufacturers in the Dallas District reported operating at above 90 percent utilization rates to catch up with below-normal inventory levels. 
The San Francisco District noted continued strength in semiconductor production, while the Dallas District said sales at high-tech manufacturing had decreased since the last report. Expectations from high-tech manufacturers in the Dallas District were that growth would remain flat to slightly weaker through year’s end, a change from earlier in the year when most contacts anticipated a pick-up in the second half. Overall, most Districts reported a moderation of expectations among their manufacturing contacts. 
Hiring at manufacturing firms continued to vary by District. Kansas City said that fewer plant managers were planning to hire, while the St. Louis District reported plans for plant expansions later in the year. The Dallas District cited particular strength in food production, citing contacts who said they planned to add several new workers. However, makers of food products in the Philadelphia District noted a falloff in demand. Cleveland and Chicago noted that automobile production remained a source of strength, with contacts from the Chicago District reporting that there was an increase in research and development activity. 
v 
Nonfinancial Services 
Demand for nonfinancial services was generally stable to slightly stronger since the previous report. Richmond noted that revenue improvement was strong among professional, scientific, and technical firms. Strength in energy, legal, and audit-related services was noted in the Dallas District. Advertisers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts reported strong revenues, and consulting and advertising contacts in the Boston District noted steady activity. Richmond and San Francisco reported that restaurants were busy, while food service contacts in Atlanta reported that demand had softened a bit. 
Transportation contacts reported that activity was generally positive. In the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, rail contacts reported strong shipments of petroleum and motor vehicles and equipment. The Richmond District reported increases in port activity with container volumes and tonnage at or near record levels. Input from logistics and trucking contacts was mixed. The Cleveland and Atlanta Districts noted softening volumes and less-robust forecasts for the remainder of the year. Kansas City’s report cited an uptick in trucking activity, while San Francisco’s report cited moderating growth in trucking. Banking and Financial Services 
Overall loan demand grew modestly in most Districts. New York indicated no change, while Richmond observed flat-to-weakening loan demand. Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted increased commercial and industrial lending, but lending in that sector decreased somewhat in the New York District and was characterized as soft in Cleveland and Atlanta. Most Districts reported an increase in mortgage lending, with Dallas noting especially strong demand and a healthy backlog of loans. Refinancing of mortgage loans was steady or increasing in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago, but Philadelphia noted a recent slowdown. Kansas City and Dallas noted some improvement in lending for agriculture and commercial real estate. The Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts observed steady-to-increasing demand for consumer credit, especially for auto loans, while consumer loan demand was somewhat weaker in Kansas City and little changed in Cleveland. 
Contacts in the New York, Richmond and Kansas City Districts reported that credit standards remained largely unchanged. Cleveland reported some loosening of auto lending guidelines, while San Francisco indicated credit standards were somewhat restrictive for businesses and consumer loans. Philadelphia, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted 
vi 
general improvements in credit quality. Delinquency rates held steady or declined in the New York and Cleveland Districts.

Auto dealers in the New York, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts reported a slowdown in recent auto sales, while auto sales held steady in the Dallas District and contacts in the Kansas City District reported a post-holiday lull in sales. All Districts reporting on sales outlooks conveyed optimism. Dealers in the Kansas City District expect demand for smaller, fuel-efficient cars to spur sales in coming months, while contacts in the Cleveland District were optimistic but uncertain that sales increases in 2011 could be repeated in 2012. 
Tourism strengthened or remained strong in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts. The Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported a decrease in tourism largely attributed to below-average snowfall. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate activity increased modestly in most Districts. Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported growth in home sales, while New York noted steady to slightly softer home sales. Philadelphia reported strong residential real estate activity. In contrast, home sales declined in St. Louis and San Francisco noted that home demand persisted at low levels. Contacts’ outlooks on home sales growth were mostly optimistic. Contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas expect home sales to rise further. Home prices declined or held steady in many areas. Cleveland and Atlanta reported little movement in house prices, while contacts in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City reported some declines. Single-family residential construction was weak in Chicago and declined in St. Louis; Cleveland noted that the year-end uptick seen in construction has abated somewhat, and Minneapolis noted increased single-family building permits. In contrast, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported increased multifamily construction activity. 
v 
Commercial real estate markets displayed positive results in some Districts, as leasing showed overall improvement. Minneapolis, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas noted increased leasing. Boston, however, reported mostly unchanged leasing fundamentals with some modest improvement since the previous report. Commercial vacancy rates were mixed in New York, decreased in Chicago, increased in St. Louis, and stayed high in San Francisco. Boston and Dallas noted limited levels of nonresidential construction, while Cleveland and Chicago noted improved nonresidential construction. 
Banking and Finance 
Reports on banking conditions were generally positive across Districts. Lending increased to varying degree in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Lending was little changed in St. Louis and Kansas City, while loan demand was described as weak in Richmond and soft at regional banks in Atlanta. Demand for business credit was flat to slightly higher in Cleveland and increased slightly in Richmond, San Francisco, and at some large banks in Atlanta. Dallas reported strength in middle-market and large corporate lending, and Chicago noted that business loan growth continued at a moderate pace. On the consumer side, loan demand saw little change in New York and San Francisco. Cleveland and Atlanta noted increased auto lending, while Kansas City reported slightly weaker consumer installment lending. Consumer lending in St.Louis ranged from moderately weaker to unchanged. Demand for residential mortgage loans increased in New York, Richmond, and Kansas City; mortgage demand was flat to moderately stronger in St. Louis and softened in Kansas City. Cleveland noted increases in requests for commercial real estate lending, while contacts in Chicago and San Francisco noted improvement in the availability of credit for this 
vi 
sector. Meanwhile Philadelphia and Kansas City reported flat or steady commercial real estate lending. Demand for commercial real estate loans was flat to moderately stronger in St. Louis. 
Overall lending standards remained restrictive in San Francisco and Richmond and were largely unchanged in St.Louis and Kansas City. Lending standards tightened further for commercial borrowers in New York. Credit conditions in Chicago improved slightly, while quality improved in Philadelphia and Kansas City. Delinquencies were steady or declined in Cleveland. Mortgage delinquencies were steady in the New York District but delinquencies decreased in other loan categories. 
Agriculture and Natural Resource Industries 
Drought conditions and warm temperatures affected agricultural conditions in some Districts. However, recent rainfalls in parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts helped ease the dry conditions. Crop yields for St. Louis were mixed, with only winter wheat, rice, and tobacco showing positive gains for 2011. Tobacco and cotton yields in Richmond were lower than historical averages. San Francisco reported growth in orders and final sales for agriculture products. Farm values and incomes were stronger in Minneapolis and Kansas City, while Richmond saw a slight drop in farmland values. 
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted higher crude oil extraction activity. Similarly, Chicago and Minneapolis reported robust activity in energy and mining, and energy- related service firms in Dallas reported very strong demand. Mining for various metals also increased in the San Francisco District. Cleveland reported flat conventional oil and natural gas drilling and production, and San Francisco observed lower demand for natural gas. The Dallas District noted drilling cuts by a few gas-directed firms, but contacts anticipate that oil-directed 
vii 
activity will offset losses. Compared with a year ago, current coal production is lower in St. Louis and higher in Kansas City. 
Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Of the Districts reporting on hiring, most indicated a slight increase. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported increased hiring in manufacturing, and contacts in Philadelphia and Kansas City anticipate future hiring in the sector. Several businesses in the Atlanta District also reported plans to increase payrolls. Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas noted increased hiring among auto dealers. Contacts in Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas were having difficulties finding skilled or specialized workers in a variety of industries. In contrast, Boston manufacturing contacts reported fewer complaints about being unable to find qualified workers. Chicago noted that hiring remains selective and long-term unemployment elevated, while San Francisco noted limited demand for new workers. Staffing firms in Boston noted that the hiring cycle remains “elongated” despite stronger demand. Staffing firms in Dallas also noted high demand, while a major employment agency in New York indicated flat hiring. 
Among Districts commenting on wages, upward pressures appeared limited. Boston noted limited pay rises in retail and manufacturing. Richmond reported some upward wage pressures in the service sector and manufacturing. Dallas and San Francisco reported minimal wage pressures, although upward pressure for certain specialized positions was reported in both Districts. Similarly, wage pressures remained largely subdued in Kansas City except for high- tech and energy positions. Wage pressures were modest or largely contained in Cleveland and Dallas, while Philadelphia noted flat wages and Minneapolis reported modest wage increases. New York noted that Wall Street compensation remains under downward pressure. 
viii 
Prices of final goods and services were relatively stable in most Districts. Retail prices increased at a moderate pace in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts. Contacts in the New York District reported modest increases in selling prices and prices paid. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted rising input prices with some expectation of pass-through to consumer prices. Cost pressures were largely unchanged in Chicago and input prices have stabilized in the Boston District, while business contacts noted some increase in cost pressures in the New York District. Minneapolis and San Francisco noted increases in the costs of employee benefits. Philadelphia noted mixed price pressures among manufacturing firms, with some firms unable to pass their higher costs along. Atlanta reported that concerns over increased input costs eased, although several manufacturing firms noted an increase in commodity prices since the previous report.",0,0
2012-02-29,"Contact reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity expanded at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period of late November through the end of December. Seven Districts characterized growth as modest; of the remaining five, New York and Chicago noted a pickup in the pace of growth, Dallas and San Francisco reported moderate growth, and Richmond indicated that activity flattened or improved slightly. Compared with prior summaries, the reports on balance suggest ongoing improvement in economic conditions in recent months, with most Districts highlighting more favorable conditions than identified in reports from the late spring through early fall. 
Consumer spending picked up in most Districts, reflecting significant gains in holiday retail sales compared with last year’s season, and activity in the travel and tourism sector expanded in most areas. Demand strengthened further for nonfinancial services, including professional and transportation services. Manufacturing activity generally continued to expand, although the pace of growth has slowed for selected subsectors such as technology products. Agricultural producers and extractors of natural resources reported generally robust conditions. Activity stayed sluggish in residential real estate markets, and conditions in commercial real estate markets remained somewhat soft overall but showed signs of ongoing improvement in several Districts. Reports from financial institutions generally indicated a slight uptick in loan demand by businesses, along with improvements in overall credit quality. 
Upward price pressures and price increases remained quite limited for most categories of final goods and services, as the effects of prior increases in the costs of selected inputs have eased. Upward wage pressures were modest overall, although a few Districts noted substantial compensation increases for workers with specialized skills in selected sectors and regions. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Reports on consumer spending were favorable in general. Most Districts reported that holiday retail sales were up noticeably over last year’s season, with New York and Dallas describing sales as “brisk” and “robust,” respectively. Consumer spending and confidence generally were characterized as firmer than in recent reporting periods, although Kansas City reported that spending softened. Items

ii identified as the strongest holiday sellers by various Districts included consumer electronics and jewelry, 
and Chicago noted that luxury items in general sold well during the holiday season. By contrast, many Districts reported weak sales and excess inventories of warm clothing, due to unusually mild weather. Retail inventories more broadly were reported to be at or near desired levels, consistent with retailers’ sales expectations. Boston, New York, and Minneapolis noted exceptional growth in Internet sales for selected items. Sales of new automobiles continued to pick up in most Districts. Among the more favorable reports, Atlanta noted that the pace of auto sales in November and December was “the strongest in over two years,” and strong demand and sales were reported as well by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis. 
Reports from most Districts pointed to solid gains or high levels of travel and tourist activity, with pickups evident in both the business and leisure segments. Tourism activity was reported to be above the levels from twelve months earlier by Boston, New York, Richmond, and Atlanta, and Boston contacts expect double-digit growth in hotel revenues in 2012. By contrast, Minneapolis reported that tourist activity was down because limited snowfall has stymied outdoor activities such as skiing and snowmobiling, while Kansas City reported a decline because winter storms hampered some tourist activity. Business travel activity also has expanded of late and is above levels from twelve months earlier, according to Atlanta and San Francisco. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Demand generally strengthened further for nonfinancial services. Providers of professional and business services such as consulting, advertising, engineering, and legal services expanded their activities according to Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Sales of technology services to businesses and consumers grew further, according to Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, although the pace of growth slowed from earlier in 2011. Providers of temporary staffing services saw strong and rising demand in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts but below-average seasonal hiring in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Reports from the health-care sector generally pointed to growth as well, with Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis highlighting construction activity and bank lending aimed at health-care providers. The exception to growing demand for health-care services was San Francisco, which reported an ongoing decline in hospital admissions. Demand for shipping and transportation services generally expanded. New York and Atlanta reported a significant increase in shipping tonnage by truck, and Dallas noted a broad-based increase in shipments by rail. Atlanta reported that port activity was up over twelve months earlier due to “notable strength in exports,” while Richmond 
iii reported a decline in port activity that was largely attributed to reduced imports. Air travel was above 
year-ago levels in the Atlanta District but unchanged over the past six weeks in the Dallas District. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity expanded in most Districts, generally continuing its steady overall expansion or, in the case of Atlanta, reversing a slowdown in prior periods. For the sector as a whole, further growth or improved conditions were reported by almost all Districts, except for Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, which reported that activity was largely stable or mixed, and Kansas City, which noted a slight decline. The strongest reports came from subsectors such as heavy equipment manufacturing and steel, for which demand has been boosted by robust growth in the energy, agricultural, and auto manufacturing sectors. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis confirmed vibrant activity for auto manufacturers, primarily for domestic makes. By contrast, demand remained somewhat weak for firms in housing-related subsectors, such as a door manufacturer in the Richmond District, furniture manufacturers there and in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts, and makers of lumber and wood products in the San Francisco District. Demand for computers and related electronic components rose further, according to Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, the pace of growth has slowed significantly from earlier in 2011, and Boston noted declining sales of semiconductors, mainly due to weaker demand from Asia. According to Dallas and San Francisco, aircraft makers saw further demand increases. Those Districts also noted weak domestic demand for refined petroleum products that was largely or completely offset by robust foreign demand. Demand grew smartly for food producers in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, but in the Kansas City District food processing was one of the weakest performers within the manufacturing sector. Export sales of assorted manufactured products generally performed well according to Atlanta and Chicago, although slower economic growth in China and Europe held back sales for some manufacturers. 
Cleveland reported that capacity utilization remained below normal in most subsectors, with the notable exception of steel producers, who were operating at or near normal levels. Similarly, Chicago noted that some auto suppliers appear to be approaching capacity constraints, which may limit further production increases in the near term. Atlanta reported that recent flooding in Thailand was likely to exert modest restraint on auto production. Ongoing capital investments and increases in capacity were reported for various manufacturing concerns in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts and for an auto producer in the Richmond District. 
iv 
Real Estate and Construction 
Activity in residential real estate markets largely held steady at very low levels, with the exception of further increases in the construction of multifamily residences. The pace of single-family home sales remained quite sluggish throughout the country, although the Dallas District reported a modest increase over the prior reporting period. Some Districts, such as Boston and Atlanta, noted that home sales exceeded levels from twelve months earlier, but mainly because the earlier levels reflected a substantial drop following the expiration of the homebuyers’ tax credit in mid-2010. Prices were largely stable on a short-term basis in most areas but in many instances were below their levels from twelve months earlier. Extensive inventories of distressed properties were reported to be a source of price restraint in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Construction of single-family homes remained at depressed levels in most areas and fell further in some, such as the Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. However, Cleveland reported that activity improved during the past couple of months. In contrast to the soft market for single-family residences, the market for rental units tightened in some areas such as the New York and Richmond Districts, and construction of multifamily residences rose in the Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. 
Demand for nonresidential real estate remained somewhat soft overall but improved in a number of Districts. Vacancy rates and other indicators in markets for office space were largely unchanged in the major metropolitan markets in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts. By contrast, New York reported that demand for office space “picked up in late 2011,” causing vacancy rates to edge down and asking rents to rise. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Chicago all reported stronger demand for commercial real estate compared with earlier in 2011, and the latter two Districts also noted a pickup in nonresidential construction activity. Cleveland and Chicago reported that the strongest demand and most extensive construction activity has been for industrial and health-care facilities, while Minneapolis highlighted growing demand for industrial space and San Francisco stressed growing demand emanating from the information technology sector. 
Banking and Finance 
Lending activity edged up overall, primarily due to increased loan demand by businesses. Most Districts that commented on lending activity indicated little or no change in overall loan demand, but the remaining Districts identified increases rather than decreases. New York reported a pronounced increase in demand for commercial mortgages, and Cleveland also noted increased demand in this category. Both Dallas and San Francisco noted a slight uptick in commercial and industrial lending. Consumer lending was largely flat compared with the prior reporting period, although auto loans rose in Cleveland. New 
v York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland reported demand growth or continued strength for refinancing of 
residential mortgages. Lending standards were largely unchanged across all lending categories. However, New York 
reported slight tightening for commercial and industrial loans. Moreover, a few reports highlighted that small businesses continued to struggle with credit access through banks. In the Atlanta District, some small businesses have turned to nonbank institutions for financing, and in the Chicago District some manufacturers have been financing loans to their suppliers from retained earnings. Credit quality improved in many Districts: New York reported a decline in delinquency rates for all loan categories, while Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported general improvement in loan quality. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Demand for agricultural products was strong during the reporting period, but growing conditions and input prices were mixed. Farm income and profits were reported to be at very high levels by Chicago and Kansas City, enabling many farmers to repay loans and expand their operations, and San Francisco reported further sales growth for a variety of agricultural products. Rising foreign demand was noted as a source of strength for livestock sales in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts and for dairy and meat products in the Chicago District. Growing conditions were somewhat mixed across areas. Farmers and livestock producers in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts have been struggling with ongoing droughts, which have required costly responses such as supplemental feeding of livestock. While timely rains eased drought conditions somewhat in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts, wheat farmers in the latter are hoping for more protective snow cover for the winter crop’s dormancy period. In addition, high or rising prices for some inputs were noted by Chicago and Kansas City, tempering farmers’ profit expectations for the coming year. 
Demand and extraction activity rose further for producers of natural resource products. Energy extraction has been on the upswing. Atlanta reported that companies have been expanding their workforces and increasing their production capacity and exploration plans in the Gulf of Mexico. Minneapolis and Kansas City reported that oil and gas exploration and extraction activity were well above their levels from twelve months earlier, and Dallas noted that a high level of activity is expected to resume in early 2012 following a year-end seasonal lull. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported expansion of mining capacity and activity for a range of industrial and precious metals. 
vi 
Prices and Wages 
Upward price pressures and price increases were very limited during the reporting period. Reports from various Districts, including Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago, indicated that upward price pressures from rising commodity and input prices have eased substantially, with Boston noting that “even food prices have ceased rising.” Atlanta reported that firms have limited pricing power in general, and San Francisco pointed to intense supplier competition as a factor holding down prices. Similarly, Kansas City reported a recent uptick in input prices but noted that few manufacturers passed these increases on to the prices of their finished goods. 
Wage pressures remained modest overall. The combination of limited permanent hiring in most sectors and numerous active job seekers has continued to keep a lid on general wage increases. However, reports from a few Districts highlighted significant supply constraints and in some cases large compensation increases for workers with specialized skills in selected sectors, including the energy sector in the Dallas District and the technology sector in the San Francisco District. On a related note, Minneapolis reported that employers have increased relocation pay for employees willing to settle in parts of that District where worker availability is limited. Increases in the costs of employee health benefits continued to put significant upward pressure on overall compensation costs, although some employers in the Philadelphia District reported significant rollbacks from past increases.",1,1
2011-11-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that overall economic activity continued to expand in September, although many Districts described the pace of growth as “modest” or “slight” and contacts generally noted weaker or less certain outlooks for business conditions. The reports suggest that consumer spending was up slightly in most Districts, with auto sales and tourism leading the way in several of them. Business spending increased somewhat, particularly for construction and mining equipment and auto dealer inventories, but many Districts noted restraint in hiring and capital spending plans. By sector, manufacturing and transportation activity was reported to have increased on balance. A few Districts also reported slight improvements in construction and real estate activity; nonetheless, overall conditions for both residential and commercial real estate remained weak. Districts reporting on nonfinancial services cited mixed results with activity varying widely by industry. Loan demand by and large moved lower, with the exception of an increase in mortgage refinancing in many Districts. Crop conditions at harvest were generally less favorable than a year ago. In contrast, energy and mining activity continued to strengthen in several Districts, with the exception of some storm-related slowdowns in the Gulf of Mexico. Cost pressures eased in the majority of Districts, though there was some further pass-through of earlier increases to downstream prices. Wage pressures remained subdued outside of a few exceptions in which firms noted having difficulty finding appropriately skilled workers. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism. Consumer spending was up slightly in September. The majority of Districts reported increases in auto sales, with the largest improvements in San Francisco and New York. Several Districts noted a greater availability of new vehicles as the supply disruptions that had plagued auto dealerships in the aftermath of the Japanese disaster subsided. Contacts in the Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts indicated that demand for used cars remained high and that some models were still scarce. A large number of Districts reported that non-auto retail sales were flat to down in September; but a few, such as Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas noted an increase in customer traffic late in the month and into early October. Back-to-school sales were described as being fairly strong in New York and

ii 
satisfactory in Richmond. In addition, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas cited some strength in the sales of big-ticket or luxury items, while Minneapolis and Chicago noted that more consumers were trading down to value products at grocery stores. 
Tourism was generally higher in those Districts reporting on the sector. Contacts in New York noted that, despite the negative impact of Hurricane Irene, Broadway and hotel revenues continued to rise. Richmond reported substantial damage from Hurricane Irene to some tourist destinations that were subsequently forced to close for repairs, but tourism remained vibrant in other areas. Boston, Atlanta, and Minneapolis also cited increases in tourism, with hospitality contacts in Atlanta expecting a robust holiday season. Tourism results were mixed across various destinations in the San Francisco district. 
Business Spending. Business spending increased somewhat from the previous report. However, contacts in a number of Districts reported that a weaker and more uncertain economic outlook had increased caution and was weighing on future spending plans. Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago indicated that many retailers were reluctant to build inventories ahead of the holiday season, pointing to recent declines in consumer confidence. Auto dealers were an exception, as they continued to replenish inventories that ran low in the aftermath of the production disruptions caused by the Japanese disaster. Capital spending continued as planned in most Districts. Respondents in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago noted increased purchases of equipment in the manufacturing, mining, and transportation industries. Boston and Minneapolis indicated that some manufacturers planned to expand capacity either through mergers and acquisitions or the building of additional facilities. Atlanta cited a pick-up in corporate expansion and relocation interest, and Chicago noted an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity among middle-market firms. 
Nonfinancial Services. Reports regarding nonfinancial services were mixed in September. Richmond noted slower overall activity, and St. Louis cited reduced demand for telecommunications, media, and education services. Demand for accounting and legal services was reported to have been unchanged in both Dallas and San Francisco. On the positive side, contacts in St. Louis reported that demand for business support services increased, and Boston reported strong business conditions for economic consulting firms involved with litigation work and advertising firms helping to market financial services. In addition, San Francisco noted continued growth in demand for technology services, Minneapolis noted an increase in activity in 
iii 
software and engineering, and Philadelphia cited some growth in logistics. Staffing at nonfinancial service-sector firms was reported to have been up slightly in Richmond, but growth slowed in Chicago and Philadelphia reported flat activity. 
Manufacturing and Transportation. Contacts indicated that manufacturing and transportation activity increased since the last report in most Districts. A large number of Districts reported higher production of autos and other transportation-related equipment. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago noted increases in auto production, and Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis all cited robust activity for auto suppliers. Dallas reported healthy demand for nondefense transportation goods. Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated continued growth in commercial aviation and aerospace manufacturing. Steel production rose in Cleveland and Chicago, and in a number of Districts metal manufacturers’ new orders also rose. Other areas of manufacturing were more mixed. The Dallas report noted a decline in refining activity. However, both Dallas and Atlanta continued to note robust oil and gas drilling activity, and this activity was said to be propelling demand for related equipment from suppliers in Chicago. Manufacturing of construction materials or equipment was reported to have increased some in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas but remained weak in most other Districts. Growth in high-tech manufacturing continued to be robust in Boston, but moderated in Dallas and San Francisco. Respondents reported that food production was up in Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, steady in Dallas, and lower in Boston. Manufacturers of consumer products reported a softening in orders in Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas, while new orders for apparel increased in San Francisco. Freight traffic increased in Cleveland and Atlanta, driven in large part by shipments of commodities, and Richmond also noted that port activity for commodities continued to be robust. However, Richmond also indicated that imports and exports, in particular of consumer goods, were both somewhat soft during what is typically the peak season for trade. 
Real Estate and Construction. All twelve Districts reported that real estate and construction activity was little changed on balance from the prior report. Residential construction remained at low levels, particularly for single-family homes. That said, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis noted small increases in single-family construction, and construction of multifamily dwellings continued to increase at a moderate pace in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Home sales remained weak overall, and home prices were reported to be either flat or declining across all of the Districts. In contrast, rental 
iv 
demand continued to rise in a number of Districts. Commercial real estate conditions remained weak overall, although commercial construction increased at a slow pace in most Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Cleveland cited some gains in demand for construction of education, healthcare, and institutional-related buildings, and New York reported an increase in hotel development. Furthermore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago noted an increase in demand for manufacturing and distribution facilities. Vacancy rates remained elevated, but Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas reported an increase in leasing activity and Philadelphia and San Francisco indicated rising investor interest in well-leased office space. 
Banking and Finance. Financial activity was reported to have weakened some since the last report. Dallas noted that the improvement in financial conditions had stalled, and Chicago indicated a further tightening of credit conditions, particularly for financial firms. In addition, New York reported noticeably weaker activity in the securities industry. Loan volumes were either flat or down slightly in most Districts. Consumer loan demand moved lower according to respondents in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City, and it held steady in New York and San Francisco. However, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City all noted an increase in mortgage refinancing activity given lower mortgage rates and Cleveland also noted continued strength in auto lending and increased demand for business loans. Meanwhile, business loan demand was described as down somewhat in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City and was little changed in most other Districts. Loan standards were described as still tight for many classes of borrowers. That said, several Districts indicated that strong competition among banks for high quality borrowers was leading to lower rates and fees for these customers. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Contacts generally reported that crop conditions at harvest were less favorable than a year ago, although results varied by and within Districts. Lower yields than a year ago were reported for major crops in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts and in most of the Kansas City District. Even so, yields were large enough to alleviate worries about shortages. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices moved down, while some contacts noted higher prices for cotton. Drought conditions persisted in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, and pastures were in worse shape than a year ago in many areas. Although there were declines in feed costs, poultry and livestock producers remained pressured by drought and the cost increases of the past year. Hog, poultry, and dairy prices decreased, while cattle prices increased. 
v 
Still, agricultural prices tended to be higher than a year ago, boosting farm incomes outside of drought-stricken areas. Chicago and Kansas City reported higher agricultural land values. 
Activity in energy-producing sectors strengthened in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Atlanta reported a decrease in off-shore operations in the Gulf of Mexico due to Tropical Storm Lee. Cleveland and Atlanta also anticipated increased capital investments in oil and gas production, since new technology has lowered costs and boosted output. Contacts in Minneapolis reported plans for expanded wind generation of electricity. Mining activity in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts was strong. 
Employment, Wages, and Prices. Respondents indicated that labor market conditions were little changed, on balance, in September. Several Districts cited only limited and selective demand for new hires. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City all noted that firms in some sectors that were hiring more broadly (such as manufacturing, transportation, and energy) were also experiencing difficulties in finding appropriately skilled or qualified labor. Respondents in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts indicated that hiring was being restrained by elevated uncertainty or lower expectations for their future growth. New York reported that deteriorating business conditions in the finance industry had led to a pull back in hiring with some layoffs anticipated in the months ahead. Richmond and Chicago reported reduced seasonal hiring in retail trade given apprehension about the strength of holiday sales, while New York indicated that seasonal hiring was likely to increase. 
Most Districts reported that wage pressures remained subdued. Exceptions were generally for workers with specialized skills or in areas where firms were having difficulty finding workers. For instance, Atlanta and San Francisco cited wage gains for workers with specialized skills, such as in information technology, Minneapolis reported wage increases in the energy industry, and Cleveland noted higher wages for truck drivers. In addition, contacts in Minneapolis and Cleveland noted increases in non-wage costs such as healthcare. Most other cost pressures moderated in September. Although Kansas City and San Francisco reported increases in raw material costs, most Districts reported a general decline in commodity prices, including prices of oil and industrial metals. Many Districts indicated that there continued to be some further pass- through of past increases to wholesale prices. Though retail contacts noted a hesitation to increase prices with demand still weak, many Districts reported increased pass-through of costs in the retail sector, particularly for food and cotton-based goods.",0,0
2011-10-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace, though some Districts noted mixed or weakening activity. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported either modest or slight expansion. Atlanta said activity continued to expand at a very subdued pace, while Cleveland reported slow growth and New York indicated growth remained sluggish. Economic activity expanded more slowly in the Chicago District and slowed in the Richmond District. Business activity in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts was characterized as mixed, with Philadelphia adding that activity was somewhat weaker overall. Several Districts also indicated that recent stock market volatility and increased economic uncertainty had led many contacts to downgrade or become more cautious about their near-term outlooks. 
Consumer spending increased slightly in most Districts since the last survey, but non- auto retail sales were flat or down in several Districts. Although poor weather dampened growth in some areas, tourist activity remained solid in most Districts. The demand for services was generally positive throughout the nation, but one region said conditions were deteriorating. Of the five Districts reporting on transportation, three said conditions were mostly positive, while the other two reported activity as flat or slightly below expectations. Manufacturing conditions were mixed across the country, but the pace of activity slowed in many Districts. Residential real estate markets remained weak overall with only a few slight improvements in some Districts. Most Districts characterized commercial real estate and construction activity as weak or little changed, but improvements were noted in several areas. Loan demand remained stable or

slightly weaker, and lending standards were largely unchanged with an improvement in loan quality. Harsh summer weather negatively affected agricultural activity, although recent rains in several Districts provided some relief. Districts reporting on energy activity said it generally expanded, with further growth expected. 
Price pressures edged lower, although input costs continued to increase in some industries and retail prices rose in several Districts. Labor markets were generally stable, although some Districts reported modest employment growth. Wage pressures were generally minimal outside of some upward movement for skilled positions. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Overall consumer spending increased slightly in most Districts, but non-auto retail sales were flat or down in some Districts. Hurricane Irene evacuations also produced widespread retail disruptions in late August in the New York District, where activity had been close to or above plan in July before slowing somewhat in early August. The Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported moderate increases in non-auto retail sales during the survey period, and sales in the San Francisco District were mixed but up slightly overall. Retail sales were up single- digits from a year ago in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, although Dallas reported no growth in sales since the previous survey period. Retailers in the Chicago District reported strong back to school sales, while Atlanta said growth slowed in retail sales. The Boston and Philadelphia Districts said sales were flat to down but with sizable variation across stores, while sales mostly weakened in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Sales of apparel and luxury items were characterized as strong in several Districts. The Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all noted sluggish sales of big ticket household items such as furniture and appliances, and contacts in several Districts thought that heightened consumer anxiety was 
iii 
weighing on sales. Contacts in some Districts continued to indicate profit margins were being squeezed by rising input costs, although grocers in the Cleveland District were passing cost increases through to customers. 
Most Districts reporting on auto sales noted increases in activity, despite lingering supply disruptions for some Japanese nameplates. The Kansas City and Cleveland Districts reported especially strong sales of fuel-efficient cars, while luxury vehicles sold well in the Minneapolis District. High demand for used cars was reported in several Districts. The New York and Philadelphia Districts reported somewhat softer auto sales in July, attributed in part to continued supply disruptions, although sales firmed somewhat in August. Tight vehicle supplies were noted in some Districts, and the San Francisco District noted ongoing shortages of Japanese nameplates. Auto contacts in the Dallas District believed the supply issues from Japanese manufacturers should be resolved by the end of September. Auto dealers in several Districts were optimistic about future sales, although contacts in the Philadelphia District said uncertainty clouded the outlook. The Cleveland District noted some easing in auto credit restrictions, and New York said both retail and wholesale auto credit conditions were good. 
Tourism activity remained solid in most Districts, although poor weather affected growth in some areas. Travel activity was reported as robust in the Atlanta District, especially for airport traffic in South Florida. Tourism in the New York City area was also very strong prior to Hurricane Irene, and city theaters planned to re-open the Monday morning after the hurricane. Both business and leisure travel posted further improvement in the San Francisco District, and tourism activity was solid overall in the Minneapolis District despite heavy rains in Montana. By contrast, tourism activity slowed in July in the Boston District, leading hotels to increase promotional offerings, and the Long Island and Jersey Shore areas of the New York District as 
iv 
well as coastal areas of the Richmond District were heavily affected by hurricane evacuations in late August. Hotels in several Districts were raising room rates, although the Kansas City District noted some easing. Nonfinancial Services 
Nonfinancial services activity edged higher in most Districts, although Minneapolis and Dallas characterized growth as flat or steady, and New York said conditions deteriorated. Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported generally solid demand for health-care services, although Richmond noted lower occupancies at senior care facilities due to difficulties among potential residents in selling their homes. Software and information technology firms in the Boston District reported mixed activity since July but expected to return to previous strong growth patterns by late 2011. The San Francisco District reported expanded sales for technology service providers due to heightened demand for software, e-books, and mobile applications. In contrast, an information technology contact in the Minneapolis District noted a decline in sales as a result of reduced demand from the government and financial services sectors. 
In transportation services, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas reported mostly positive conditions, while activity was flat in the San Francisco District and below expectations in the Kansas City District. Railroad shipments rose slightly in the Dallas District, with particularly strong volume growth in metallic ores, petroleum products, and non-commercial building products. Cleveland noted an acceleration in capital spending, mainly to replace aging equipment and support demand growth from energy customers. Trucking firms in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts reported a shortage of qualified drivers, and a few firms noted concerns about higher fuel costs. Many services contacts expressed substantial uncertainty about future business activity, with a few Districts reporting weakened outlooks for transportation. 
v 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing conditions were mixed across the country, but the pace of activity slowed in many Districts. The New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts reported declining activity overall, and contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts noted slowing demand from European customers. Cleveland said factory production was stable, and manufacturing activity in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts grew at a slower pace. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported slight expansions, and St. Louis said activity continued to increase and that several manufacturers planned to open plants and expand operations in the near future. Most manufacturing contacts were less optimistic than in the previous survey; however, future capital spending plans were solid in a few Districts. 
Looking across factory sectors, auto production decreased in the Cleveland District due to normal seasonal retooling for model changeovers, and the Chicago District said auto production leveled off in August after a strong July. Textile manufacturers in the Richmond District said markets have grown weaker due to declining consumer confidence. Construction- related manufacturing was characterized as weak in the Dallas and Philadelphia Districts, and Boston noted a cyclical decline in semiconductor demand. Philadelphia reported a decline in food manufacturing, and the Kansas City District noted weakness at nondurable goods plants. In contrast, commercial aircraft manufacturers in the San Francisco District reported solid production rates due to new orders for narrow-body aircraft and a growing order backlog. A metal fabricator in the Minneapolis District announced plans to expand a facility in northwestern Montana. Capacity utilization in the steel industry remained at record high levels in the Chicago District, and a tire manufacturer in the Atlanta District noted particular pressure in meeting a recent surge in new orders due to supply chain normalization after the Japan disaster. 
vi 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate activity remained weak overall, although a few Districts noted some slight improvements. Contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported an increase in home sales over the previous year’s weak levels; however, the uptick in the Atlanta District was concentrated mainly in Florida. The remaining Districts all reported stable or slower sales from the previous survey period, with several citing greater economic uncertainty as the primary cause. Both the New York and Philadelphia Districts reported that a growing backlog of foreclosures in New Jersey continued to weigh down the housing market. Home construction was down or stagnant in most Districts, with the exception of Minneapolis and Kansas City. However, several Districts indicated an improvement in home remodeling activity, and the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts reported increased demand for multi-family housing projects. Home prices were flat to slightly down in several Districts, although New York said prices in many areas edged higher but remained below year-ago levels. Contacts in the Boston District reported competitive pricing by sellers with even lower prices negotiated by buyers, but in the Cleveland District many builders have shifted away from discounting. Inventories were elevated or rising in the Boston, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, particularly for existing homes, and demand for apartment rental space increased in the San Francisco and Dallas Districts. 
Commercial real estate conditions remained weak or little changed in most Districts, although some improvements were noted by New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Commercial real estate activity was sluggish in the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. However, San Francisco noted some areas have benefited from technology sector growth, and Boston noted investor demand for prime office buildings 
vii 
remained strong. New York said office vacancy rates declined noticeably in the Buffalo and Rochester metro areas and modestly in Manhattan and Long Island. Lower commercial rents helped push down vacancy rates in the Kansas City District, and the Dallas District noted strong demand for leased space in Houston due to solid energy activity. Commercial construction was characterized as weak or limited by Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City, although Atlanta noted some strength in the healthcare sector. St. Louis described conditions as mixed, with some improvement in education and energy-related construction, while Minneapolis District contacts reported an increase in small retrofitting projects and rebuilding in flood- damaged areas. The Chicago District noted continued strength in industrial construction, particularly in the automotive sector. Credit for commercial development remained an obstacle for small retailers in the Richmond District, although Boston said aggressive competition among lenders led to reduced borrowing rates. 
Banking and Finance 
Most districts cited overall loan demand as stable to slightly weaker, with the exception of St. Louis, which reported a modest increase. Demand for business loans remained unchanged or weakened in the New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, but was moderately stronger in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts. Demand for consumer loans increased somewhat in the St. Louis District, but was unchanged to slightly weaker in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. While Kansas City reported a decline in commercial real estate loans, St. Louis cited a modest increase. New York and Cleveland noted increased demand for residential mortgages. 
Most Districts said that loan quality was generally improving and that credit standards were largely unchanged. Cleveland reported a decline in delinquencies across all loan categories, 
viii 
and Richmond and Kansas City also indicated a continued strengthening in loan quality. However, New York indicated that delinquency rates increased on most categories of loans and that banks tightened standards for commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans. Banking contacts in several Districts also referenced concerns about the economy. The Chicago District cited recent volatility in financial markets and reduced expectations for economic growth, while Kansas City District contacts listed a weak economic recovery and uncertainty about financial regulations. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Harsh summer weather strained agricultural activity in many Districts since the last survey period. Hot, dry weather stressed crops and livestock in the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, with poor pasture conditions hastening herd liquidations in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Recent rains provided some relief to agricultural producers in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, but Hurricane Irene caused extensive damage to field crops not yet harvested in North Carolina. Shrinking production estimates pushed up crop prices and the Chicago District noted that robust ethanol production was also driving corn prices higher. Crop and livestock sales rose in the San Francisco District, and the Dallas District reported strong beef exports. Farmland values rose further in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts, but rising input costs trimmed farm capital spending in the Kansas City District. 
Energy activity generally expanded since the last survey period, with additional gains expected in coming months. The Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported an increase in land-based oil drilling activity, and the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported a modest rise in off-shore drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas exploration rose in the Cleveland District, and remained steady in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. 
ix 
Additional capital investments in oil and gas production were expected in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts. Energy contacts in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts noted some new hiring, although permit delays and environmental compliance could constrain expansion. Coal production rose in the Kansas City District, held steady in the Cleveland District, and fell in the St. Louis District. Higher metals prices spurred mining activity in the Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts, especially for iron ore. 
Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Labor markets were generally steady, although some Districts reported modest employment growth. Several Districts reported a shortage of skilled workers such as engineers, mechanics, and software developers. Jobs in the health care industry continued to increase, and the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts indicated growth in energy-related employment. Many Districts reported an increase in auto sales and service technician positions, and several companies in the Minneapolis District announced new manufacturing jobs. The Atlanta District noted that many contacts were focused on productivity and efficiency increases with existing staff, and Richmond said one firm would rather pay overtime than hire new workers. A large staffing firm in Chicago reported a decline in billable hours for staffing and professional services as well as fewer permanent placements, while Boston said demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring continued to grow. A major New York City employment agency reported unusually slow hiring activity in August but remained cautiously optimistic about future recruitment. Most Districts reported that wage pressures were minimal, but contacts noted some wage gains for several skilled positions as a result of heightened demand. 
x 
The majority of Districts reported fewer price pressures, but input costs continued to rise in select industries. The New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts noted some stabilization or decline in raw materials prices but Chicago said elevated commodity prices continued to put pressure on costs, particularly copper and steel. Manufacturers in the Boston District were able to pass through input price increases with little resistance, although a semiconductor firm was one exception. The Kansas City District reported construction materials prices as steady, excluding prices of petroleum-based products such as roofing shingles and asphalt, which continued to rise. Retail prices were steady or rising slightly in New York, Richmond, and Atlanta, although some Atlanta District retailers mentioned that weak sales could prompt them to lower prices. Retailers in the Dallas District noted a slight decline in overall prices, although increases were observed in certain high-end goods and cotton-based products. Prices for cotton-based products, such as clothing, also increased in the San Francisco and Cleveland Districts. Food prices climbed higher in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, and restaurants in the Kansas City District expected further increases in menu prices as a result of rising food costs.",1,1
2011-08-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity continued to grow; however, the pace has moderated in many Districts. The six Districts nearest the Atlantic seaboard reported a slowdown in activity since the previous Beige Book report; activity was little changed in the Atlanta District and unchanged or slightly improved in the Richmond District. Of the other six Districts, the Minneapolis District reported political and weather-related disruptions that temporarily slowed growth, and the Dallas District slowed to a moderate pace of growth. The remaining four Districts continued to grow modestly. The previous Beige Book reported a slower growth rate for four Districts, seven Districts growing at a steady pace, and one District with faster growth. 
Consumer spending increased overall, with modest growth of nonauto retail sales in a majority of Districts. Falling gasoline prices throughout most of this reporting period may have encouraged a pickup in shopping trips and some additional spending since the previous Beige Book. Price pressures from food, energy, cotton, and other supplier inputs continued to squeeze retail margins. Auto sales slowed a little since the previous Beige Book, with inventories still lean due to Japanese supply chain disruptions. The summer tourism season has started off stronger than last year in most areas unaffected by severe weather. 
Activity among nonfinancial service sectors improved overall in most Districts. Of the five Districts reporting on transportation services, volumes were mostly up. 
 Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and based on information collected on or before July 15, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
Manufacturing activity expanded overall, with two Districts growing at a somewhat faster rate since the last Beige Book, many Districts reporting steady or slowing growth, and two Districts reporting little change. Among firms reporting on near-term expectations, the manufacturing outlook remained generally optimistic, but capital spending plans were somewhat more cautious. 
Most residential real estate activity was little changed and remained weak, although construction and activity in the residential rental market continued to improve since the previous Beige Book. For six Districts, activity in the nonresidential real estate market has improved slightly for specific submarkets, although conditions generally remained weak across all twelve Districts. Since the last Beige Book, overall loan volumes have increased in three Districts, decreased in two Districts, and were relatively flat, often with mixed trends across the banks’ portfolios, in five Districts. Credit quality was steady or improving. 
Drought conditions and severe flooding adversely affected large portions of the seven Districts that reported on their agricultural sectors. Districts that reported on their energy and mining sectors continued to note strong growth for most energy-related products but some weakness in coal production. 
Although most Federal Reserve Districts observed modest hiring increases, labor market conditions remained soft. Wage pressures continued to be subdued for all but a few specific occupations in some Districts. Price pressures moderated somewhat in many Districts, although some firms indicated that they were able to pass on some cost increases to their customers. 
iii 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending increased overall in most Districts since the last Beige Book. The New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts indicated modest growth of nonauto retail sales, and the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts noted relatively strong growth. Retailers in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts reported mixed results across product lines, while St. Louis District retailers reported slowing sales. Stronger sales in some New York City stores were attributed to tourism, while one large mall in western New York credited Canadian shoppers as the source. A major Philadelphia District retailer suggested that increased shopping trips and a greater willingness to spend were due to lower gas prices since the last Beige Book. Inventory levels were not a strong concern. Contacts from half of the Districts noted upward pressure from supplier prices—cotton was often mentioned—and other non-labor inputs, especially food and energy. Some retailers were able to pass through some cost increases, but for many, especially restaurants, profit margins were squeezed. Restaurant contacts in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts still managed to report strong sales. 
Reports of auto sales were mixed across Districts and varied by vehicle make, with most Districts indicating that dealer inventories were lean primarily due to lingering supply disruptions for Japanese vehicles and parts. Auto dealers in the Kansas City District cited strong sales despite reduced incentives and credited, in part, continued low interest rates and tornado damage. The Chicago District noted lower sales in June as incentives decreased and showroom traffic declined, followed by improved sales in early July. The New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted varying degrees of lower sales stemming from Japanese supply 
iv 
constraints. Strong demand for smaller vehicles and used cars continued in several Districts. The Cleveland District described dealers’ outlook as cautious due to uncertainty about gas prices, the economy, and vehicle availability. 
Tourism activity strengthened in most Districts as the summer season got underway. The Richmond District reported that bookings along the Mid-Atlantic coast were comparable to the 2010 season, despite last year’s increase from additional vacationers who were avoiding the Gulf Coast oil spill. The New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts also reported increased tourism. Tourism was also up in parts of the Kansas and Minneapolis Districts, except for destinations adversely affected by drought, heavy rains, flooding, and Minnesota’s state government shutdown. Nonfinancial Services 
Growth of nonfinancial services advanced further during this Beige Book period for the Districts overall. The Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported the strongest advances. The Philadelphia and Richmond Districts reported slight improvements, while activity in the New York District flattened. Respondents remained optimistic about growth over the next three to six months in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. However, the New York District’s contacts were less optimistic than they were when polled for the previous Beige Book. High-tech firms in the Kansas City District expressed an optimistic outlook and planned to increase capital spending. 
Among the five Districts that reported on transportation services, freight transport shipping volumes in the Cleveland District, port activity in the Richmond District, and intermodal cargo volumes in the Dallas District expanded somewhat. The Kansas City 
v 
District also reported increased activity, while Atlanta District firms indicated that their domestic volumes of freight and parcels were slowing somewhat. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity expanded overall, with two Districts reporting somewhat stronger growth since the last Beige Book, many Districts reporting steady or slowing in growth, and two Districts reporting little change. Auto production in the Cleveland District rose moderately, as supply disruptions caused by events in Japan diminished. The Kansas City District also reported a rebound in manufacturing activity from a low level in the prior survey period, while activity at high-tech firms expanded further. Foreign demand for metal fabrication and overall demand for semiconductors and other technology products contributed to slightly faster growth rates in the San Francisco District. Manufacturers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported continued growth at a relatively steady pace from the previous reporting period. The Chicago District cited a rebound in auto production and strong demand for heavy trucks and equipment. 
Growth continued among manufacturers in the Boston and Dallas Districts as well; however, results were more mixed. Contacts in the Boston District cited stronger growth for products related to foreign demand, non-luxury consumer goods, and clients addressing deferred maintenance needs. Softer growth was reported by firms delivering consumer luxury goods, and products or services to the small business, banking, and government sectors. 
Manufacturing firms in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts reported somewhat slower rates of growth overall. However, the Philadelphia District 
vi 
reported a lull early in the period, followed by resumption of a slow rate of growth in early July, while the Richmond District reported moderate gains, which stalled in early July. Manufacturing firms in the New York District reported a pause in growth throughout the period. 
Manufacturing firms’ expectations of future activity were optimistic in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts, although Boston’s firms were less positive than in the previous Beige Book, and Philadelphia’s firms were more positive. Firms in the Boston District indicated limited plans for capital spending, while firms in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts maintained plans for capital spending at prior levels. Fewer firms in the Cleveland District were reporting delays to project starts for their capital spending plans. Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate sales in almost all Districts were little changed from the last Beige Book. Activity edged up in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. Of the Districts reporting on home prices, most said that they were flat or declining. The Boston and Richmond Districts reported steady prices; the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts reported that prices were steady to down slightly; and the Kansas City and New York Districts reported that prices were down. Increasing inventories of unsold homes in the Boston, New York, and Kansas City Districts have restrained building in the single- family housing sector. Residential construction activity overall was mixed, though it increased in the Minneapolis District. Since the previous Beige Book, construction and activity in the residential rental market have continued to improve in the New York, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. 
vii 
Nonresidential real estate activity improved somewhat in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. The Chicago District reported strong demand for industrial facilities, particularly from the automotive sector. The Philadelphia District reported improvements in terms of lower vacancy rates for office space, industrial space, and apartments; the Chicago District reported generally lower vacancy rates. The New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all reported generally weak activity in nonresidential real estate. Construction in the Minneapolis District stalled in areas because of flooding and unavailability of state building inspectors due to the Minnesota state government shutdown. Health care and apartment construction was a bright spot for the Atlanta District. Activity was weak in the Kansas City District, but firms that supply construction materials reported increased sales and stable prices. San Francisco reported stable but high vacancy rates in many parts of the District. Banking and Finance 
Reports of loan demand were more mixed than in the previous Beige Book. The New York, Richmond, and Chicago Districts reported overall increases in loan demand but from different sources. Commercial and industrial loans accounted for the growth in the New York District, while consumer loans accounted for the growth in the Chicago District. Loan growth in the Richmond District was driven by consumer lending, real estate loans for apartments, and commercial loans for larger companies. Total loan volume decreased in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts, reflecting decreases in real estate lending and individual loans in St. Louis and reductions in consumer installment, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans in Kansas City. The 
viii 
Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported relatively little overall change in loan volume, while the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts reported mixed results. Outside of banking, the San Francisco District indicated increased investment activity by venture capital firms and higher levels of IPO activity. 
Credit conditions have changed little since the previous Beige Book. Banks in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported that credit quality was flat or somewhat improved. Bankers in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted that competition among lenders for high-quality borrowers was squeezing banks’ margins and lowering the cost of capital for those borrowers. Bank contacts in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts indicated that credit standards were mostly unchanged at tight levels, but the Cleveland District heard a few reports of easing standards for good borrowers. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Severe drought conditions adversely affected parts of the Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, causing low crop yields, complete crop losses, wildfires, and loss of grazing land in many areas. The Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that ranchers had culled herds or placed cattle on feed lots in response to poor pasture conditions, despite higher feed lot costs that trim their margins. Meanwhile, the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts noted that flooding had caused millions of acres to go unplanted. The Atlanta District reported that rain brought relief to some stressed pastures and crops, but farm labor shortages had impaired Georgia’s fruit and vegetable production. The St. Louis District reported fair or better conditions for corn, soybean, sorghum, rice, and cotton crops, plus an increase from 2010 in its winter 
ix 
wheat production. Kansas City reported good or better conditions for corn and soybean crops. Agricultural prices were mixed since the last report, with the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reporting lower cattle and wheat prices, while soybean and dairy prices were up. Chicago also reported higher prices for hogs. 
Activity in the energy sector remained strong. Shale exploration increased in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts. The Cleveland District also reported little change in the production of oil, natural gas, or coal, despite rising demand for coal. The St. Louis District reported higher coal production than the prior year. The Minneapolis District reported continued strong mining activity and mixed plans for wind farms and biodiesel. The Kansas City District reported expanded drilling activity and higher ethanol production but weak coal production. The Dallas District also reported strong drilling activity, and the San Francisco District reported strong activity for metal mining, along with oil and gas extraction. Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Labor market conditions remained soft in most Federal Reserve Districts. Employment, especially among temporary hiring agencies, improved in the Richmond District in recent weeks. Modest hiring increases, often within specific sectors such as advertising in the Boston District and manufacturing in the Cleveland District, contributed to modest overall employment gains. Small gains were also noted in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. The New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago Districts reported a slowdown in the pace of hiring activity. A staffing firm in the Chicago District reported a decline in billable hours. 
x 
Wage pressures remained subdued in most Districts and for most occupations. For the overall labor market, the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported limited wage pressures. Wage pressures or wage increases were characterized as modest or moderate by the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Boston District contacts reported wage growth between 3 percent and 5 percent in consulting and advertising. In addition, contacts in the Kansas City District reported labor shortages and wage pressures in the retail sector and for many occupations in the high-tech, energy, and transportation sectors, while the San Francisco District reported continued wage pressures for specialized information technology workers. 
Price pressures seemed to have moderated somewhat, although some firms reported being able to pass on some rising costs. Overall, input price pressures appeared to have fallen modestly. Input price increases remained elevated in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Meanwhile, the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts reported moderation in input price pressures relative to the previous Beige Book. For the most part, firms’ ability to pass on price increases remained mixed. A few Districts reported some sectors being able to pass on rising prices, such as the retail sector in the Chicago District and service-sector firms in the Dallas District.",0,0
2011-07-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity generally continued to expand since the last report, though a few Districts indicated some deceleration. Some slowing in the pace of growth was noted in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. In contrast, Dallas characterized that region’s economy as accelerating. Other Districts indicated that growth continued at a steady pace. Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most parts of the country, though a number of Districts noted some slowing in the pace of growth. Activity in the non-financial service sectors expanded at a steady pace, led by industries related to information technology and business and professional services. 
Consumer spending was mixed, with most Districts indicating steady to modestly increasing activity. Elevated food and energy prices, as well as unfavorable weather in some parts of the country, were said to be weighing on consumers’ propensity to spend. Auto sales were mixed but fairly robust in most of the country, though some slowing was noted in the Northeastern regions. Widespread supply disruptions—primarily related to the disaster in Japan—were reported to have substantially reduced the flow of new automobiles into dealers’ inventories, which in turn held down sales in some Districts. Widespread shortages of used cars were also reported to be driving up prices. Tourism activity improved in most Districts. 
* Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on information collected on or before May 27, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
Residential construction and real estate continued to show widespread weakness, except in the rental segment, where market conditions have strengthened and construction activity and development have picked up. Non-residential real estate leasing markets have been generally stable, while construction activity has remained very subdued. Loan demand was steady to stronger in most Districts, especially in the commercial and industrial sector, and widespread improvement was reported in credit quality. 
Agricultural conditions were unfavorable across much of the nation, largely reflecting unseasonably cool and wet weather; widespread flooding along the Mississippi River hampered agricultural production in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts. In the Dallas District, in contrast, drought conditions hurt the wheat crop and led to broader damage from wildfires. The energy industry showed continued strength, with robust expansion in oil drilling and extraction activity. 
Labor market conditions continued to improve gradually across most of the nation, with a number of Districts noting a short supply of workers with specialized technical skills. Wage growth generally remained modest, though there were scattered reports of steeper increases for highly skilled workers in certain occupations. Most Districts continued to report widespread increases in commodity prices; manufacturers are said to be passing along a portion of the higher costs in the form of price hikes and fuel surcharges. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending was generally described as steady to up modestly since the last report, with most Districts indicating small increases from a year ago. Non-auto retail sales were indicated to be expanding steadily in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, while sales were characterized as stable or decelerating in the New 
iii 
York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Sales were reported to have declined in the Richmond District, and Boston described sales as mixed but generally down from a year earlier. Retail inventories were generally said to be at satisfactory levels, though St. Louis characterized inventory levels as being on the high side. A number of Districts noted that a combination of unfavorable weather and high fuel and food prices have weighed on consumer spending in recent weeks. Cleveland and San Francisco noted increased spending on discretionary items, and Philadelphia indicated that some luxury goods retailers fared relatively well. On the other hand, Chicago reported a decline in discretionary spending. 
Most Districts reporting on vehicle sales indicated that they have been steady to stronger since the last report, specifically Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco. In addition, Atlanta noted firm demand for automobiles. On the other hand, some softening in car sales was noted in the northeastern Districts of New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland. Many Districts indicated that supply disruptions, primarily from Japan, have contributed to lean inventories, which have impeded auto sales somewhat. There has also been widespread tightening in the market for used cars, reflecting both strong demand and a shortage of inventory. Shifts in consumer demand toward smaller, more fuel efficient cars were noted in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts, while St. Louis mentioned a shift from higher-end to lower-end models. 
Tourism activity has generally strengthened since the last report, and the outlook for the summer season looks positive. Improvement in this sector was reported in the Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts; in addition, New York reported that tourism increased in April but appeared to edge back in early May. Dallas maintained that 
iv 
travel activity has been mixed, while Minneapolis indicated that tourism has been slow recently due to adverse weather, but that inquiries and advance bookings for the summer season look strong. St. Louis noted that flooding forced the temporary closure of numerous casinos along the Mississippi River. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Activity in the non-financial service sectors continued to strengthen in most Districts, with the notable exception of St. Louis, which reported fairly widespread declines. Service sector activity generally expanded in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, though Richmond noted deceleration in the pace of growth. There were also pockets of strength in particular sectors. Information technology firms saw activity expand in the Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Employment agencies in the Boston and Chicago Districts indicated continued improvement in activity, while New York and Dallas reported some slowing in this industry. New York, Richmond and Minneapolis cited strengthening in business and professional services, while San Francisco indicated steady to mixed activity in this sector. 
Activity in the transportation sector improved in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Philadelphia and Richmond noted some slowing in growth, and New York reported steady shipping activity, while San Francisco indicated a slowdown in cargo traffic at Southern California seaports. Dallas also reported weakening in container trade volumes but noted increases in cargo volume, railroad shipments and small parcel shipments. 
v 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity was reported as continuing to increase since the last report in all but two districts, although many noted that the pace of growth had slowed. The Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, Districts reported that activity expanded, and the Dallas District reported a pickup in demand; the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts reported that activity expanded but at a slower pace, while activity was reported as steady in the New York District and stable to growing in the Cleveland District. Supply disruptions related to the earthquake in Japan led to reduced production of automobiles and auto parts in several Districts. The Cleveland District noted a sharp drop in auto production, the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts also saw production fall, and auto deliveries were reported as having declined in the Richmond District. The Atlanta District said lost production in its region would be made up later in the year. Contacts in the Chicago District said that contingency plans to deal with supply disruptions were helpful in mitigating the effects. High-tech firms in the Boston and Dallas Districts reported that shortages of parts, due to disruptions in Japan, had adverse effects on business; in contrast, there were few supply constraints that affected technology-related products in the San Francisco District. 
Growth was reported as strong for semiconductors in the San Francisco and Boston Districts. The Cleveland District reported that steel producers were seeing shipping volumes level off after a strong first quarter performance, and the Chicago District noted a decline in second quarter orders for industrial metals, although orders for the third quarter were coming in at a more positive pace. A contact in the Richmond District said that demand for industrial metals had leveled off. The Chicago District reported a decline in activity for construction 
vi 
materials and household goods. Production remained strong for makers of commercial aircraft and parts in the San Francisco District. 
Looking forward, contacts in most districts were generally optimistic about the outlook, although less so than the last report. The Cleveland District said that the majority of manufacturing contacts maintained a favorable outlook, although some are delaying the start of capital projects. Contacts were generally cautiously optimistic in the Boston District, although some expect sales growth to moderate. Contacts were mostly positive about the outlook in the Philadelphia District, though the level of optimism was not quite as strong as in the last report. Chicago District contacts expect conditions to rebound in the coming months. A majority of contacts in the Atlanta District planned to increase production. Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate sales markets showed continued weakness in most Districts, while rental markets strengthened. Most Districts indicate that home prices have declined since the last report: Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco all report some downward drift in selling prices, while reports from the New York and Cleveland Districts indicate that prices have been steady, on balance. No district indicates a general increase in home prices. Sales activity, though widely reported to be at low levels, picked up somewhat in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Dallas indicated that improved traffic has raised prospects of improved sales in the second half of 2011, and Boston observed signs that the market is stabilizing. Sales activity was characterized as mostly steady in the New York, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, but declining in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts. Those Districts reporting on the residential rental market—specifically, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, 
vii 
Dallas, and San Francisco—all indicate that conditions have strengthened. In terms of residential construction, activity has remained generally depressed, with a number of Districts reporting a large overhang of distressed properties. However, a number of Districts—New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco—report improved prospects for development of multi-family rental properties. 
Commercial and industrial real estate markets have generally been steady since the last report, though there have been scattered signs of a pickup. Commercial leasing markets showed modest signs of improvement in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts. Boston and Dallas noted some firming in property sales markets, but Kansas City reported declines in prices for office buildings. Non-residential construction, though widely reported to be at very low levels, rose modestly in the Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, though Chicago noted that public sector projects are becoming smaller. Cleveland observed a pickup in industrial and high-end commercial development but a pullback in healthcare- related projects. Richmond reported some pockets of strength in the retail market. More broadly, contacts in a number of Districts expressed a general sense of optimism about the outlook for the second half of 2011. Banking and Finance 
Most Districts described loan demand as mixed or slightly improved since the last report. Consumer loan demand showed some improvement in the Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts, but held steady or weakened in the New York, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Demand for residential mortgages (including new purchases and refinances) increased in Cleveland but held steady in New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, 
viii 
and San Francisco Districts noted a modest uptick in business loan demand. The increase in business loan demand in Cleveland was described as broad-based, including a pickup in construction loan requests for multi-family dwellings. Boston noted an improved lending environment for commercial real estate, and demand for commercial mortgages increased in New York and Dallas. Commercial and industrial loan activity increased in Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, held steady in New York, and decreased in Kansas City. Outside of banking, Chicago and San Francisco indicated increased investment activity by hedge funds, venture capital firms, and other forms of private equity. 
Credit standards were reported to be mixed but, on balance, a bit easier in recent weeks. New York, Cleveland, and Atlanta noted increased credit availability for automobile loans; Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco indicated easier credit for some types of business loans. Boston reported some easing in commercial real estate lending, but New York reported tighter standards in that segment. Credit standards on home mortgage loans tightened somewhat in the St. Louis District. A number of Districts noted improvements in overall credit quality: specifically, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. New York indicated rising delinquency rates on consumer loans but declining rates on commercial loans and mortgages. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agriculture conditions were unfavorable in many districts, with various weather related difficulties leading to delays and below-average plantings of key crops. Excess precipitation and cool temperatures delayed the planting of corn, soybeans, and other crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, although Richmond reported that some parts of its District benefited from favorable weather 
ix 
conditions. Cool temperatures also delayed the development of some crops in the San Francisco District. Flooding on the Mississippi River slowed activity for farmers in the St. Louis and Atlanta Districts. The Dallas District reported that drought conditions had become severe and that the wheat crop was expected to be particularly poor; wildfires also led to significant agricultural losses in its District. Commodity prices were reported as strong in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts, but were down in the Chicago District. Hog prices were higher in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, while cattle prices were reported as lower in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts but higher in the Minneapolis and Atlanta Districts. 
Activity in the energy industry remained robust. Drilling activity was reported as strong and growing in the Dallas District, and work is being re-permitted in the Gulf of Mexico. The San Francisco District reported that oil extraction activity grew strongly in response to rising demand overseas, and that the demand for natural gas continued to expand. In the Minneapolis District, oil exploration activity increased. Contacts reported an increase in drilling activity in the Kansas City District, although shortages of equipment and labor created some drilling constraints. The St. Louis District reported that coal production was modestly lower. Employment, Wages and Prices 
Most Districts reported gradual improvement in labor market conditions since their last reports. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all noted general improvement in employment conditions, while job growth was mostly limited to the manufacturing sector in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts. Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring increased in the Boston, Richmond, 
x 
Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. While labor was generally available, contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts indicated that labor market conditions have tightened for workers with specialized technical skills, particularly in the healthcare and technology sectors. Despite signs of continued modest improvement in most labor markets, Minneapolis noted several examples of expected layoffs and St. Louis reported plans for layoffs in the District’s services sector. 
Wage pressures were reported to be largely contained in most Districts, as abundant labor availability has continued to limit the pace of wage growth. Modest wage pressures were reported in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while wages were reported as steady in New York and Philadelphia. However, contacts in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted that wage increases have been more significant for some highly skilled workers in occupations with labor shortages. Firms’ expectations for labor and benefits costs moderated slightly in Atlanta. 
Input prices continued to increase in most Districts, particularly for agricultural commodities, petroleum-based products, and industrial metals, although the pace of growth slowed in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. In addition, several Districts reported that fuel surcharges have increased or become more widely used since the last report. While Boston indicated that firms were able to pass along most input price increases into selling prices, contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted only a limited ability to pass through these cost increases to their customers, with manufacturers generally being more successful than retail or construction firms. In general, selling prices increased only modestly, except for food and 
energy prices, which continued to escalate. In addition, low inventory levels contributed to price increases for used cars in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Plans to implement future increases in selling prices were reported in the Boston, New York, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.",0,0
2011-05-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity generally continued to improve since the last report. While many Districts described the improvements as only moderate, most Districts stated that gains were widespread across sectors, and Kansas City described its economic gains as solid. Manufacturing continued to lead, with virtually every District citing examples of steady improvement, often with reports of increased hiring. Retailers in the Boston District reported mixed sales results and retail sales remained weak in the Richmond District, but all other Districts experienced at least slight gains in consumer spending and the New York District cited robust sales. Business services, including freight-related activities, improved in most Districts. Loan demand was either unchanged or up slightly in most Districts, with New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City citing weaker lending. Residential and commercial real estate performance varied across Districts. Seven of the Districts described commercial real estate as slightly improved, while five noted that their markets were flat. While most Districts noted little change in their residential real estate markets, half of the Districts cited at least pockets of weakening. 
Reports focusing on the near-term outlook were most often upbeat. Some Districts, however, also noted that uncertainties remained high. Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas all noted actual or expected disruptions to sales and production as a result of the tragedy in Japan. Most Districts reported signs of improvement in at least some of their labor markets and Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City cited examples of concern among their contacts about being able to obtain certain types of skilled workers. Some businesses in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts still preferred to hire temporary over permanent workers. 
Wage pressures were described by most Districts as weak or subdued, but higher commodity costs were widely reported to be putting increasing pressures on prices. Energy prices were cited most often, but raw materials in general were an increasing concern of businesses. The ability to pass through cost increases varied across Districts, with manufacturers

ii 
generally finding less resistance to price increases than either retail or construction (where weak demand was a limiting factor). Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending picked up modestly across most Districts since the last report. Consumers were shopping for necessities and looking for lower-priced options or promotional items in the Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. New York reported strong retail sales in February and March, but noted weaker sales at two major retail chains in New York. Retailers in the Cleveland District reported higher sales relative to a year ago, although a few contacts cited considerable stress in the low- to mid-market segments. Richmond reported weak sales, including for big-ticket items, and Boston received mixed sales reports. Big-ticket sales, particularly for home furnishings, picked up in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas Districts, but remained subdued in the San Francisco District. 
Automobile sales rose in most Districts. Dallas noted higher foot traffic at auto dealers and Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco indicated that improved availability of credit helped to boost car sales. In the Richmond District, however, vehicle sales were generally unchanged or sluggish, while dealers in the Chicago District reported a slight decline. Contacts in several Districts expressed concern about potential supply chain disruptions due to production problems in Japan. 
Tourism strengthened in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, although Japanese tourism in Hawaii dropped. Tourist activity picked up in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts, as visitors enjoyed late-winter sports, and early attendance at the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, D.C. was above average. New York noted that hotel occupancy and attendance at Broadway theaters rose above year-ago levels. Nonfinancial Services 
Non-financial service firms generally reported expansion, although Minneapolis and Atlanta heard mixed reports. Demand for business-to-business services increased in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Boston and Minneapolis cited stronger demand for advertising and marketing services. In addition, respondents in several Districts reported higher demand for seasonal accounting services. Contacts at firms providing travel-related services in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts also reported an uptick in demand. 
iii 
Kansas City District restaurateurs said sales were up, but the average check amount had declined; in contrast, restaurant contacts in the Atlanta District gave mixed reports and some in the St. Louis District planned to decrease operations. 
Reports from transportation services firms were mostly positive. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts reported an increase in freight transportation volume, notably for vehicles and construction materials. Dallas received mixed reports, however, citing weaker international demand for intermodal transportation; container volume flattened, while railroads reported moderate increases. Carriers in the Atlanta District reported increased air travel for business and leisure, while airlines in the Dallas District indicated traffic was steady. New York and Richmond cited a strengthening in freight trucking, and port activity rose in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts. Shippers in the Atlanta District anticipated temporary disruptions resulting from the disaster in Japan. Manufacturing 
All twelve Districts reported that manufacturing activity increased since their previous reports. Ten of the twelve Districts cited a further pickup in production, while Cleveland and Dallas observed steady to slightly improving activity. Dallas said overall demand in manufacturing rose slightly from low levels, noting gains in food, plastics, and construction- related products. Richmond and Chicago reported substantial increases in auto and auto parts manufacturing. Cleveland indicated that auto production overall dipped slightly, but that domestic automakers showed a substantial rise in production. Moreover, St. Louis mentioned that automobile parts and electrical equipment manufacturers reported plans to open new plants in their District. Boston and Kansas City reported that growth of high-tech goods was strong, but several contacts in the Dallas District said that high-tech shipments to Japanese factories declined. Boston and Richmond District respondents attributed a lack of new contracts from federal government agencies to the uncertainties surrounding the budget for fiscal year 2011. San Francisco reported that makers of commercial aircraft and related parts had modest growth in new orders, which they attributed in part to increased demand for aircraft with greater fuel efficiency. Philadelphia said that manufacturers of fabricated metal products and industrial machinery cited higher demand. Similarly, steel producers and metal service centers in the Cleveland District reported that shipping volume met or exceeded expectations, with shipments driven by energy-related, transportation, and heavy equipment. 
iv 
Comments on the outlook were generally positive. Boston mentioned that manufacturers generally remained cautiously optimistic but voiced greater uncertainty about the outlook for the rest of the year, based on the disruption at Japanese facilities, the geopolitical climate worldwide, and ambiguity about U.S. government spending plans. Likewise, Chicago commented that contacts’ optimism was tempered by elevated uncertainties surrounding recent global events. New York and Kansas City stated that contacts remained optimistic about the near-term outlook, and Philadelphia indicated that more than two-thirds of their manufacturers expected business conditions to improve in the next six months. Real Estate and Construction 
Real estate markets for single family homes for the most part either were little changed from low levels or continued to weaken across all Districts. Residential construction was described by Chicago as subdued and the spring building season is likely to be slower than previously anticipated. Market activity was still declining in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, while activity in the New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts remained weak. Atlanta characterized the market as mixed, with Florida brokers providing most of the signs of improvement. Both Philadelphia and Atlanta noted that brokers expected the market to improve, and builders in the Cleveland District were more optimistic than in the past several months. A few Districts found pockets of improvement. For example, Philadelphia reported that agents were seeing a pickup in inquiries, showings, and traffic, although there was little increase in sales or construction. Boston noted higher activity in just the last few weeks, due in part to improved weather, and Richmond said that the market for lower- priced homes improved. The multifamily markets strengthened in several Districts, including Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, both in terms of leasing and construction activity. 
Commercial real estate activity remained weak across all Districts, although seven reported slight improvements since their last report. Market activity was still slow in the St. Louis and Philadelphia Districts and remained at low levels in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts. Markets in the San Francisco District were characterized as subdued, but leasing activity increased among technology firms. Most other Districts noted improvements, albeit slight, in activity. For example, Chicago and Kansas City cited moderate gains in construction, with Chicago highlighting gains in healthcare and automotive industries. 
v 
Improvements in the Cleveland District were also driven by healthcare projects and, to a lesser extent, by manufacturing and energy. Office and industrial leasing improved in the Richmond District, although retail was little changed. Banking and Financial Services 
Most Districts cited loan demand as either unchanged or slightly improved since the last report, although many of the Districts citing improvements noted weak demand in some market segments. Banks in the Chicago District noted that their pipeline was still not robust, although manufacturing, food processing, and healthcare experienced some growth. Cleveland reported that business lending was strongest in healthcare and in energy. Consumer loan demand showed some improvement in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, but was little changed in the Chicago District. Overall loan demand was weak or little changed in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts, although Philadelphia noted some improvement in commercial and industrial loans and in some types of commercial real estate loans. However, New York described household demand (for both consumer loans and mortgages) as weakening in its District, and St. Louis noted declines across most segments of its market, including real estate, commercial and industrial, and personal loans. 
Several Districts reported that credit standards were unchanged or slightly tighter and that competition for quality loans was intense. For example, Cleveland described credit standards as unchanged, while New York noted no change for consumer loans but tightening for other categories in its District. San Francisco noted that credit standards remained somewhat restrictive. Cleveland characterized loan quality as stable or slightly improved and delinquency rates as stable or trending down. However, New York mentioned an uptick in delinquency rates for commercial and industrial loans. Competition for quality loans was described as intense in the Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, putting downward pressures on rates and fees. Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Most Districts reported that labor market conditions were generally stronger than in their last reports. New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all noted increased employment activity, while Boston and Atlanta reported modest or gradual improvement. However, Philadelphia, Cleveland and San Francisco mentioned limited or delayed hiring, while labor market conditions were mixed in the St. Louis District. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas cited noticeable improvements in the manufacturing 
vi 
sector, and Boston and Kansas observed increased labor demand in the technology sector. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis received upbeat reports from staffing agencies. New York said that a major employment agency experienced a marked pickup in hiring activity in March, describing it as ―the best month in years.‖ A staffing contact in the Cleveland District noted moderate growth in the number of new job openings, with vacancies concentrated in health care, energy and professional business services. A large staffing firm in the Chicago District reported solid growth in billable hours and a substantial increase in permanent placement and recruiting activity, while contacts in the Philadelphia District were inclined to delay additions to permanent or temporary staff. Employers in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts said that they were experiencing difficulty in recruiting highly specialized workers. Despite signs of improvement in most labor markets, St. Louis and Minneapolis reported examples of layoffs in the manufacturing sector of their regions. 
Input prices rose in most Districts, particularly for cotton and other agricultural commodities, petroleum-based products, and industrial metals. In addition, shippers added fuel surcharges in several Districts. Boston, Cleveland and Atlanta cited increasing cost pressures, and some manufacturers in Boston were raising their selling price to pass costs along to customers. The ability to pass through increases, however, varied in both the Chicago and Atlanta Districts, with manufacturers generally being more successful than retail or construction firms. Contacts in the San Francisco District reported a limited ability to pass through higher input prices on anything other than food and gasoline. Kansas Cited stated that more manufacturers and retailers expected to raise prices in coming months. 
Wage pressures were reported to be mostly contained, especially in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Kansas City noted wages generally held steady, even with expanded hiring, and wage pressures were expected to be contained except for highly competitive or specialized positions. Wage pressures were described as modest in the Chicago District. However, Richmond reported slightly faster wage increases. Boston reported that nearly all of the manufacturing firms that they contacted planned to implement merit increases, and one contact planned a greater merit pool next year to compensate for previous low raises. Philadelphia noted some concern about rising nonwage employment costs, but wages for business firms in the District were mostly steady. 
vii 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Assessments of agricultural activity were mixed. Varying degrees of drought conditions persisted in the Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, with Chicago indicating that some areas in their District did not have adequate subsoil moisture to endure dry spells. In the Kansas City District, agricultural growing conditions generally worsened in late February and March. In particular, winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated further as the drought in the southern Plains intensified. Dallas reported that drought conditions became more widespread in March, covering more than 90 percent of the District. However, Dallas noted that planting was underway despite concern about the lack of soil moisture for spring crops. Chicago also indicated that planting should proceed quickly in most of the District, as fields were in good condition with ground moisture sufficient for an excellent start to the crop year. Moreover, the Minneapolis District continued to enjoy good conditions in spite of wet weather and spring flooding. Most Districts reported that prices of fuel and feed continued to put downward pressure on margins, but prices for most agricultural commodities remained strong. Atlanta said that strong global demand contributed to elevated prices for some farm acreage, while Kansas City attributed higher farmland values to strong crop prices and a limited number of farms for sale. 
Activity in the energy industry generally strengthened since the last report. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported increased drilling activity as demand firmed. In the Atlanta District, deep-water drilling permits were issued in late February for the first time since the Gulf oil spill last April, although the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico was still only about half the number prior to the spill. In the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts, coal production remained above year-ago levels, but was stable to moderately lower in the Cleveland District. Kansas City reported increased drilling activity, with exploration shifting away from natural gas toward crude oil, while Cleveland indicated that oil and gas output held steady. In the San Francisco District, extraction activity for natural gas expanded, while Minneapolis reported that late-March oil exploration activity increased since mid-February. Minneapolis also noted that iron ore mines in northern Minnesota were operating at full capacity, with expectations that 2011 production will be the highest in more than 10 years.",0,0
2011-04-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that overall economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace in January and early February. Both Kansas City and San Francisco noted that their economies expanded further. Boston and Philadelphia cited conditions as improving. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis described activity as modestly improving, while Minneapolis and Dallas experienced moderate growth. Chicago reported that although there was an increase in activity, it was at a pace not quite as strong as during the previous reporting period. 
Retail sales increased in all Districts, except Richmond and Atlanta, although Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City noted that severe snowstorms had a negative impact on merchant activity. Retail inventory levels were described as desirable in New York, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco. Tourism improved in Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco, while New York and Kansas City noted a slowdown in activity as hotel occupancy rates declined. Some Districts reported a slight increase in the level of residential real estate activity, although all Districts maintained that the overall level of home sales and construction remained low. Several Districts indicated improvements in commercial real estate sales and leasing activity, including Boston, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Most reports characterized nonresidential construction as weak. 
All Districts, except St. Louis, experienced solid growth in manufacturing production, and new orders improved for Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Most regions observed an increase in nonfinancial services. Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco reported that sales advanced for services related to information technology, while Kansas City noted softer sales of IT services.

ii 
Changes in loan demand were mixed across Districts, with Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco experiencing increased loan demand and Kansas City noting a decrease. Lending standards remained tight across most Districts. Labor markets modestly improved across the country. Boston, Richmond, and Chicago reported more permanent job placements occurring in the market, while Atlanta businesses reported a continued preference for hiring temporary workers rather than permanent workers. Several Districts described an increase in demand for staffing services, especially for high-skilled IT positions. Adverse weather conditions continued to hamper agricultural production in many Districts, but strong prices helped producers of cotton, corn, soybeans, wheat, poultry, hogs and cattle. Energy production expanded or remained stable, according to reporting Districts. 
Non-wage input costs increased for manufacturers and retailers in most Districts. Manufacturers, in a number of Districts reported having greater ability to pass through higher input costs to customers. Retailers in some Districts mentioned they had implemented price increases or were anticipating such action in the next few months. Homebuilders in Cleveland and Atlanta had limited ability to pass through cost increases to buyers. Most reporting Districts noted continued strong agricultural commodity prices. Wage pressures remained minimal across all Districts; although Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco noted that most wage increases were for workers with specialized skills. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Retail spending strengthened compared with a year ago across all Districts except Richmond and Atlanta, where sales were reported to have softened modestly. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas commented that severe winter weather in January had a negative impact on retail activity. New York, Chicago, and San Francisco observed that consumers are still responding to promotions and discounting. Meanwhile, Cleveland noted that some of their low- to mid-market segments are still struggling. Some Districts observed an increase in discretionary spending; luxury and big-ticket item sales increased in Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco. Inventories were at desired 
iii 
levels in New York, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco, while contacts in St. Louis had mixed views about their inventory levels. Boston and Atlanta reported tight inventory management. The outlook among all Districts was for a modest increase in retail activity. 
Automobile sales increased compared with a year earlier in most Districts. Chicago and Dallas observed that auto sales held steady, while Kansas City’s contacts said sales softened because of inclement weather but expected them to rebound in the near future. Cleveland and Chicago noted increased availability of auto financing, and Cleveland reported an increase in leasing activity. Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated that vehicle inventories were at appropriate levels for the current sales rate, while inventories were mixed in Cleveland and lean in New York and San Francisco. All Districts conveyed optimistic outlooks among their auto contacts. 
Tourism reports improved in the Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts. Atlanta observed a strong increase in international visitors. Kansas City noted a slowdown in tourism amid severe weather but added that ski resorts benefited from the snowfall. New York reported a larger-than-usual seasonal slowdown in tourism with decreases in hotel occupancy rates and Broadway theater attendance, although the level of activity remained fairly high. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Recent activity in residential real estate varied, but overall sales and construction remained at low levels across all Districts. The Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported a slight improvement in the level of recent activity, while Boston noted that activity was mixed across New England. New York described the housing market as stable with some pockets of improvement. Demand was unchanged according to reports from the San Francisco District. Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas described recent activity as sluggish, and St. Louis noted sales continued to decline. Construction activity was described as flat or down by Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Philadelphia and Atlanta contacts attributed weaker buyer traffic in January to inclement weather, and Philadelphia noted a pickup 
iv 
in early February. Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas also indicated an increase in buyer traffic. Reports on home prices were mixed. Atlanta and Kansas City observed persistent downward price pressure. Home prices continued to fall according to Philadelphia reports, but mainly at the high-end of the market. Cleveland and Chicago contacts described prices as little changed. The outlook for residential sales and construction improved marginally, although activity is expected to remain at low levels. Kansas City contacts anticipate a seasonal surge in sales activity this spring. Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco also expect modest improvement, while little to no sales growth is expected among Philadelphia contacts. A slight uptick is expected in Chicago and San Francisco construction. 
Commercial real estate activity showed signs of gaining traction according to a number of District reports. Boston, Chicago and Dallas reported that commercial real estate activity improved overall, while Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted increases in leasing activity. Kansas City described the market as stabilizing, while Philadelphia and Minneapolis reported that markets were flat overall, and New York described conditions as ―slack‖ and St. Louis as ―soft.‖ Nonresidential construction remained weak according to most accounts. The Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts reported weak levels of construction activity, while Chicago noted a slight pickup. Cleveland District contractors cited increasing inquiries, and unexpected growth in commercial construction was noted in the Minneapolis District. Overall, contacts anticipate a slow recovery in commercial real estate markets. 
Manufacturing 
Reports from eleven of the twelve Reserve Banks indicated that manufacturing activity improved since the previous report, while St. Louis attributed a decline in manufacturing activity to several factory closings. Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted solid expansion in production, but Chicago observed a more moderate rise in output than in its last report. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Minneapolis indicated that adverse weather conditions temporarily disrupted production. Philadelphia and 
v 
Atlanta noticed that a higher percentage of contacts indicated that production levels would increase in the near term. Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas also described the manufacturing outlook as optimistic. 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported more rapid improvement in factory orders. Chicago cited steel, automotive, and heavy equipment manufacturing as sources for significant new orders growth, while Dallas noted that orders for high-tech goods had accelerated. Philadelphia and Atlanta suggested that increases in orders were more broad-based. Cleveland and Richmond observed that orders were increasing at the same pace as in their previous report. Demand from abroad, particularly Asia, was cited by several Districts as a driving force in new orders. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Districts reporting on nonfinancial services noted increased activity. Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas observed rising demand for general professional business services, with several reports singling out accounting firms. Dallas noted that much of this rise in demand for accounting services was related to consulting and transactional work. Several Districts also cited increased demand for healthcare, insurance, and legal services. The New York District, while reporting that legal hiring had picked up a bit, observed that it was from very low levels. St. Louis reported overall strength in business services, although contacts in government services and religious organizations announced plans to decrease operations and lay off workers. San Francisco also saw improved demand for consumer and business services, but countered that providers of healthcare, legal, and accounting services reported that demand remained largely flat. Information technology and telecommunication providers experienced increases in sales, according to the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Kansas City observed softer sales by IT firms, especially those tied to federal stimulus spending, but noted that activity generated by data centers and e-commerce were characterized as strong. 
vi 
Transportation services firms in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts reported an increase in shipments. Cleveland contacts hinted at the possibility of hiring more drivers but also expressed concern over the tightening of the labor pool. Transportation firms in several Districts expressed concerns over rising fuel costs. 
Banking and Financial Services 
Loan demand varied across District and loan category. Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco noted improvements in overall loan demand, while Kansas City observed a decrease. Demand for residential real estate loans increased in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas but was weaker in New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City. The New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts reported improvements in commercial loan applications. The Dallas District experienced mixed commercial loan demand, while St. Louis noted that demand was unchanged to weaker. Cleveland reported business loan applications were beginning to pickup but demand for consumer loans remained soft. The Philadelphia District expected little change in loan volume as consumers remained reluctant to borrow. 
Most Districts reported that credit standards were unchanged to tighter. Kansas City reported standards were unchanged for all types of loans. New York noted some tightening of commercial loan standards but little change in the standards for residential mortgages or consumer loans. The Atlanta District reported increased standards for residential mortgage loans. St. Louis indicated standards had tightened somewhat for commercial mortgages, but were unchanged for C&I loans, and were unchanged to somewhat tighter for residential mortgages. San Francisco noted relatively restrictive standards for both consumer and commercial loans. 
Community bankers in the Chicago and Dallas Districts cited increased competition for C&I lending from large banks. Atlanta noted improvements in credit conditions for all loan segments except those related to residential construction and real estate. Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and 
vii 
Dallas indicated steady to improving credit quality, and New York reported steady to lower delinquency rates. San Francisco reported that venture capital financing was improving with increased investor interest and IPO activity. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Adverse weather conditions continued to hamper agricultural production in many areas. Extremely cold and/or dry conditions negatively affected crops or livestock in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts. Kansas City also reported poor growing conditions. St. Louis described mixed results for production in many crops, but large increases in rice and cotton production were noted. Most reporting Districts noted continued strong commodity prices were benefitting producers of cotton, corn, soybeans, wheat, poultry, hogs and cattle while there are also some reports of rising input prices, particularly in fertilizer and feed prices. San Francisco observed some boost in export sales for timber companies. 
Energy activity expanded or remained stable since the last report. Kansas City and Dallas noted strong drilling activity, while Cleveland and Atlanta reported a decline in permit issuance. In the Atlanta District, drilling activity remained below pre-Gulf of Mexico oil spill levels, although up slightly since October 2010. Coal production remained above year-ago levels in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts and held steady according to Cleveland. Kansas City reported that oil and gas production increased, while Cleveland noted that production held steady. San Francisco reported that global demand supported oil extraction, while Minneapolis experienced stable oil exploration. 
Prices and Labor Markets 
Manufacturing and retail contacts across Districts reported rising input costs. Manufacturers in many Districts conveyed that they were passing through higher input costs to customers or planned to do so in the near future. Homebuilders in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts noted rising material costs, but 
viii 
acknowledged little ability to pass through the costs to buyers. Retailers in some Districts mentioned they had implemented price increases or were anticipating such action in the next few months. There is little evidence of wage pressures across Districts. Wages remained steady in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, while moderate wage pressures were reported in the Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco noted that most wage increases were for workers with specialized skills. 
Labor market conditions continued to strengthen modestly, with all Districts reporting some degree of improvement. The Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts cited noticeable improvements in the manufacturing sector, and the Boston and Cleveland Districts also observed increased labor demand in the healthcare and medical sectors. New York reported little or no hiring in the manufacturing sector, although their factory contacts planned on increasing hiring in the coming months. The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts received optimistic reports from staffing agencies. Dallas said that staffing firms experienced continued strong demand, particularly for high-skilled IT positions. The Cleveland District staffing contacts noted some growth in the number of new job openings, with vacancies concentrated in healthcare, manufacturing, and professional business services. Chicago reported that a large staffing firm reported solid growth in billable hours for both industrial and for office and clerical positions, as well as increases in both temporary-to- permanent job transitions and direct hiring of permanent employees. Boston, Richmond, and Chicago noted increases in the conversion of temporary to permanent hires and permanent job placements, while contacts in the Atlanta District reported a preference for hiring temporary staff. Employers in the Boston District reported difficulty in finding qualified candidates for high-skilled jobs. Despite the improvement in most labor markets, some Districts such as New York, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Dallas also noted layoffs in the region.",0,1
2011-02-28,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity continued to 
expand moderately from November through December. Conditions were said to be improving in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts. Activity increased modestly to moderately in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. The economy of the Minneapolis District “continued its moderate recovery,” while that of the San Francisco District “firmed further” in the reporting period leading up to the close of 2010. Conditions were generally said to be better in Districts’ manufacturing, retail, and nonfinancial services sectors than in financial services or real estate. 
Contacts in the manufacturing sector in all Districts reported that activity continued to recover, with the Richmond and Chicago Districts citing especially solid gains in orders. However, the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts noted that business remained weak for manufacturers selling into the construction sector. Retailers in all Districts indicated that sales appeared to be higher in this holiday season than in 2009 and, in some cases, better than expectations. Nonfinancial service-sector contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts cited demand increases ranging from slight to “relatively strong.” Transportation services were more mixed, with the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noting stable to slowing shipping volumes. Financial conditions were mixed across the Districts reporting on it, with overall loan demand slowly improving in Philadelphia and Richmond and weaker in St. Louis and Dallas. The Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts cited increased activity in the energy sector, while energy production in the Cleveland District was stable. 
Residential real estate markets remained weak across all Districts. Commercial construction was described as subdued or slow, while commercial leasing activity reportedly increased in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. 
1 Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information collected on or before January 3, 2011. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
i 
Most District reports cited comments by both retailers and manufacturers that costs were rising, but indicated that competitive pressures had led to only modest pass-through into final prices. Labor markets appeared to be firming somewhat in most Districts, as some modest hiring beyond replacement was said to have occurred and/or was planned in a variety of sectors. At the same time, however, upward pressure on wages was reportedly very limited. 
Most Districts indicated that business contacts were positive about the outlook, although still generally cautious. The Dallas District noted modest increases in optimism and positive outlooks across a range of sectors, Chicago stated that contacts were cautiously optimistic about the 2011 outlook, and New York cited widespread optimism about the near-term outlook; The St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all pointed to planned increases in hiring by their contacts as evidence of expected strengthening in business activity in 2011. Contacts in the Philadelphia District foresaw “improving economic conditions in 2011, but ... not strong growth.” 
Manufacturing 
The manufacturing sector continued to recover across all Districts. Contacts in the Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts identified a strong flow of new orders. Respondents in the Chicago District pointed to pent-up demand for both light and heavy motor vehicles, attributed to an aging fleet, as a key driver of activity in the manufacturing sector. The Cleveland District described orders as above expectations and respondents in the New York District noted that orders had picked up since the prior report. Overall, demand was generally characterized as stable and steady, and no District made mention of lingering fears of a double-dip recession, in contrast to the summer reporting periods. Capacity utilization continued to trend higher and is approaching normal rates for some contacts in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts, while production in high-tech manufacturing was reportedly at high capacity in Dallas; some manufacturers in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts said they have or will soon expand capacity. Production levels increased in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. On the negative side, the Philadelphia District characterized the flow of new orders as ""erratic,"" 
ii 
while the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts identified construction-related manufacturers as continuing to show considerable weakness, and makers of wood products in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts reported very soft demand. 
The Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts reported concerns about input prices, particularly of commodities; manufacturers in the Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts indicated they had experienced lengthening lead times, shortages, or other difficulty obtaining supplies of some inputs. Only St. Louis mentioned firms with substantial investment plans for 2011. Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported that some factories had plans to increase employment, although these hiring plans were typically characterized as modest. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts described the 2011 manufacturing outlook as optimistic. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Retail spending showed improvement across all Districts, with most retailers reporting sales growth consistent with or ahead of plan for the recent 2010 holiday season. Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City observed consumers positively reacting to promotions and discounting, although Philadelphia and San Francisco reported that retailers relied less heavily on discounting. Inclement weather, including the late December blizzard, had some impact on sales in the New York and Philadelphia Districts. New York , Cleveland, and Chicago cited increased consumer confidence. 
Automobile sales were either steady or up in eight Districts during the reporting period, while New York stated that auto sales were “mixed but generally at favorable levels” and Kansas City noted limited auto sales but expected future improvement from additional incentives. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas indicated that vehicle inventories were at appropriate levels for the current sales rate. Cleveland reported an increase in leasing activity, while the effect of rising gasoline prices on sales of less fuel-efficient models was a concern cited by some dealers in Philadelphia. 
iii 
Tourism was characterized as positive or improved in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while New York described tourist activity as brisk. Contacts from the Richmond, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts observed a strong start to the winter ski season, although unfavorable weather conditions at the end of December led to deteriorating conditions for winter activities in some areas of the Minneapolis District. New York City's Broadway theaters reported increased attendance and revenue compared with the 2009 holiday season. Occupancy rose in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts’ major hotel markets. Room rates continued to run ahead of comparable 2009 levels in the New York and the Kansas City Districts, although rates have fallen in Kansas City since the last survey. Atlanta and San Francisco noted rising business travel. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Activity was said to be steady to increasing among Districts reporting on nonfinancial services. Providers of information technology services saw increases in sales in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Advertising and consulting contacts in the Boston District reported significant growth in demand. In the Dallas District, legal firms noted an uptick in demand for services, while accounting firms reported seasonal slowness. Reports from the healthcare sector were mixed; St. Louis and Minneapolis reported ongoing increases in demand for healthcare workers, while San Francisco indicated a slight weakening in demand for healthcare services and Richmond reported little change. Demand for staffing services remained on an upward trend, with increases reported by New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago. In addition, an employment-agency contact in the New York District observed increased demand for employees in the legal and financial services sectors, while the Dallas District noted strong, steady demand for workers in the professional, technical, healthcare, and finance fields. Reports from the transportation services sector were mixed, with increased demand reported by trucking firms and airports in the Richmond District, and slower overall activity in the Kansas City District. Freight companies in the Cleveland District noted stable volumes over the past six weeks, and contacts in the Atlanta District reported moderating freight volumes after significant increases in earlier 2010 reporting periods. 
iv 
Real Estate and Construction 
Activity in residential real estate and new home construction remained slow across all Districts. A majority of the Districts, including Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized local housing markets as weak and sluggish with little change from the previous reporting period. Kansas City noted further weakening, while Richmond received reports of both flat activity and further declines. The St. Louis District saw additional declines in existing home sales, but also cited increased new home construction permits. All Districts attributed slumping activity to concerns about the pace of economic recovery, especially in employment, while the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts mentioned difficulty obtaining credit as another constraint on demand. High levels of existing home inventories continued to damp the pace of new home construction in most Districts reporting on construction, although Boston, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco mentioned pick-ups in multifamily construction within their Districts. Home prices generally declined or held steady in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts; the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts mentioned distressed properties placing downward pressure on prices. Boston reported rising median home prices across most states in the District, but contacts attributed those increases to relatively higher sales of more expensive properties rather than a general upward movement in home prices. Outlooks for residential real estate in the coming year were mixed, with contacts in most Districts described as expecting continued weak conditions. 
Commercial real estate markets displayed mixed results across the Districts again this reporting period, as leasing markets exhibited increasing signs of recovery and nonresidential construction remained weak. Leasing activity increased modestly in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts and showed tentative improvement in the Dallas District. Vacancy rates, while quite high across the country, fell marginally in the Kansas City District and in New York City’s office market. Leasing market fundamentals held roughly steady in the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco 
v 
Districts. Commercial construction activity was described as very limited across most Districts, with the bulk of new activity coming from projects related to healthcare, public infrastructure, and multifamily housing. Contacts in most Districts expected modest improvements in commercial leasing in 2011, although the outlook for construction was mixed and some Districts noted rising costs as a concern. 
Banking and Financial Services 
Reports on credit activity were mixed across Federal Reserve Districts. Overall, loan demand was reported as stable in San Francisco, mixed in New York, steady to slightly softer in Kansas City, weaker in St. Louis and Dallas, and slowly improving in Philadelphia and Richmond. Demand for consumer loans declined in the New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. By contrast, consumer lending increased in the Dallas District, and exceeded expectations in the Chicago District. Bankers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond anticipate consumer lending to expand in 2011. Demand for commercial and industrial loans was flat in New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Lenders in the New York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted a drop in residential mortgage refinancing owing to the recent rise in interest rates, whereas Richmond reported strong demand for home refinancing. The Cleveland and Richmond Districts observed a pick-up in auto lending. Demand for residential real estate loans eased in New York and Kansas City, remained weak in Cleveland and Dallas, but increased in the Richmond District. Real estate lending declined in the St. Louis District. Lending in the commercial mortgage category increased in New York, was unchanged in Kansas City, and was weak in Dallas, with the exception of multifamily. Most Districts reporting on credit quality described it as improving, while bankers in the Cleveland District said that quality remained stable or edged up slightly. Reports on credit standards were mixed in New York, while standards were said to have eased somewhat in Atlanta, remained restrictive in San Francisco, and held steady in Kansas City. Delinquency rates were flat or trending down in Cleveland, while delinquency rates in the New York District rose for commercial mortgages, decreased in the 
vi 
consumer lending category, and remained unchanged for all other loans. Total deposits rose in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts and were stable in the Kansas City District. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Unfavorable weather conditions damped agricultural production in some areas. The Dallas District reported that drought negatively affected range conditions by adding to costs of feeding livestock, while Atlanta cited the challenges prolonged drought presented to fruit growers. The Kansas City District indicated that dry weather could affect winter wheat development. Large snow falls hampered some ranchers in the Minneapolis District. However, agricultural demand generally improved among reporting Districts, and output prices rose, especially for corn, soybeans, wheat, cattle, and cotton. 
The Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported increased drilling activity. Cleveland cited fairly stable oil production, while the Atlanta District experienced the highest level of oil production in more than six years during the fourth quarter of 2010. Prices for crude oil and natural gas either stayed steady or slightly increased in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Cleveland reported steady coal production and prices, while the St. Louis District saw coal production increase. 
Prices and Labor Markets 
Most District reports mentioned increasing prevalence of cost pressures but only modest pass- through into final prices because of competitive pressures. Philadelphia and San Francisco noted somewhat reduced discounting in the retail sector during the holiday selling season, while New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated retail prices were stable, Richmond said retail price increases had slowed, and Chicago and Kansas City cited discounting or depressed retail margins. For both retailers and manufacturers, increases in selling prices, if occurring, were said to be selective. Specific markets or products identified as experiencing high or rising prices included various food products, steel and other metals, building materials, textiles, chemicals, and petroleum-related products. Many Districts mentioned concerns among business contacts that petroleum-related prices, already above year-earlier levels, will 
vii 
continue rising in 2011. The Philadelphia and Kansas City reports indicated that manufacturing firms planned to attempt more price increases in 2011, while some manufacturers in the Boston District were uncertain their price increases would stick and the Chicago report projected only “limited and gradual” pass-through. 
Labor markets in most Districts appear to be firming somewhat, but with virtually no upward pressure on wages. All District reports indicated that employment levels are rising in at least some sectors, generally by modest amounts; however, some employers in the New York, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts also mentioned job cuts. Staffing firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts gave positive reports; Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta said some firms were raising work hours instead of or in addition to hiring. The Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts indicated that business contacts planned to continue or increase their pace of hiring in 2011. Some employers in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts expressed concern about added costs for healthcare; the Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts noted selected skill shortages in some sectors. Overall wage pressures remained subdued; the Philadelphia District reported “mostly steady wages,” Cleveland said “wage pressures are contained,” Chicago indicated “wage pressures remained moderate,” Minneapolis and Kansas City stated wage increases or wage pressure “remained subdued,” and the Dallas and San Francisco reports described wage pressures as “minimal” or “largely absent.”",0,1
2010-11-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that, on balance, national economic activity continued to rise, albeit at a modest pace, during the reporting period from September to early October. 
Manufacturing activity continued to expand, with production and new orders rising across most Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services was reported to be stable to modestly increasing overall. Consumer spending was steady to up slightly, but consumers remained price-sensitive, and purchases were mostly limited to necessities and nondiscretionary items. New vehicle sales held steady or rose during the reporting period; sales of used automobiles were strong as well. Activity in the travel and tourism sector picked up. 
Housing markets remained weak with most Districts reporting sales below year-ago levels. Reports on prices suggested stability, however. Conditions in the commercial real estate sector were subdued, and construction was expected to remain weak. Lending activity was stable in most Districts. Agricultural conditions were generally favorable, and above-average yields were expected in most reporting Districts. Activity in the energy sector continued to expand. 
Input costs, most notably for agricultural commodities and industrial metals, rose further. Shipping rates increased, and retailers in some Districts noted rising wholesale prices. However, prices of final goods and services were mostly stable as higher input costs were not passed on to consumers. Wage pressures were minimal. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity continued to expand, and several Districts reported gains in production or new orders across a wide range of industries. The only exceptions were the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, where activity softened compared with the previous reporting period. Exports boosted manufacturing activity according to contacts in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Producers of semiconductors and other high-tech equipment saw continued growth in sales in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Auto production rose strongly in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Metals producers in the Chicago District reported that September sales were the strongest year-to-date, while contacts in the Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts saw only modest gains. Shipments of steel in the Cleveland District continued to be buoyed by demand from energy-related, automotive, and

ii 
heavy equipment industries. Food processors in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts noted solid demand for their products, while a few contacts in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts reported plans to expand existing operations. 
Refiners in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts noted a slowdown in activity and rising inventories. Demand for construction-related products remained weak, and reports on activity in the wood products and furniture manufacturing industries were mixed. 
Hiring at manufacturing firms remained sluggish. Inventories were generally light or in line with orders. Future capital spending plans appeared to be limited, except for in the St. Louis District where several manufacturers reported plans to build new plants or expand operations. Manufacturers’ assessments of future factory activity were optimistic in the New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, where contacts expect business conditions to remain positive or to improve in coming months. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Activity was stable to modestly increasing for most professional and nonfinancial services. Demand for information technology (IT) services remained solid. IT firms in the San Francisco District noted recent growth was spurred by business investment to enhance production efficiency. In the Minneapolis District firms noted solid demand for IT services from corporate clients. 
Accounting activity improved slightly, spurred by merger and acquisition work. Contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts noted increases in consulting activity since the last report. Healthcare consulting picked up as businesses responded to regulatory changes following healthcare reform. Appraisal and title companies noted continued strength during the reporting period, and there were some reports from architectural firms that activity had picked up. 
Demand for transportation services appears to have slowed, although reports were mixed. Freight companies in the Cleveland District noted steady to declining volumes over the past six weeks, and Kansas City’s report said transportation firms saw unexpected weakness. Rail companies in the Atlanta District reported positive, but slower growth of automobile and industrial goods shipments, while port activity in the Richmond District was mixed. Dallas’ report said intermodal and railroad cargo volumes edged up, but growth in international container trade volumes flattened, and small parcel shipping volumes declined in September. San Francisco reported a pickup in demand for trucking services. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Retail spending was flat to moderately positive in most Districts, with the exception of the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, which noted declining traffic and sales. Contacts in the Kansas City 
iii 
District noted sales were stronger than expected; back-to-school spending boosted sales in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts. Retail spending grew modestly in the Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts, and was flat in the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Retailers said consumers are slowly regaining confidence, but remain price-conscious and were largely limiting purchases to necessities and nondiscretionary items. There were reports, however, of a pickup in sales of moderately priced household goods in the Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and gains in apparel sales were reported in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Inventories were at desired levels. Looking ahead, retailers in several Districts expected modest sales growth through year-end. In particular, some contacts in New York planned to add more holiday staff than last year. 
Most Districts reported that sales of new vehicles held steady or rose during the reporting period. Sales of used vehicles were strong as well. Inventories remained tight, particularly for popular vehicles. Used car prices rose, reflective of solid demand and lean inventories. Respondents’ outlooks were for slight growth in sales through year-end. 
Reports from most Districts pointed to continued improvement in travel and tourist activity. The Richmond District reported that tourist activity strengthened, and contacts in San Francisco noted that growth in business travel and convention activity led to rising visitor counts and hotel occupancy rates. Hotel occupancy for popular tourist destinations in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts also rose during the reporting period and was above year-ago levels. New York’s report noted that hotel occupancy rates remained high in Manhattan, but October bookings were somewhat weaker than expected. Atlanta noted that tourist activity in some areas was still being affected by the Gulf oil spill, but losses incurred in these areas were offset by increased activity in Northeast Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee and respondents’ outlooks for the remainder of the year were positive. Airline traffic was stable to slightly down according to the Dallas District, but conditions were much better than a year earlier thanks to strength in business travel. Restaurants and food service contacts in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts also noted slight increases in activity. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Housing markets remained weak. Most District Beige Book reports suggested overall home sales were sluggish or declining and were below year-ago levels. There were scattered reports of some improvement in sales in a few Districts, however. Philadelphia noted an increase in sales of existing homes, and Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas reported upticks in sales of higher-priced homes. Sales reports were mixed in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, with increases in some metro areas and declines in others. Home inventories were elevated or rising according to most District reports. Home prices were generally stable since the last report, although Kansas City noted a decrease in prices, and 
iv 
New York and Minneapolis reported declines in some metros. Homebuilders in the Atlanta District reported downward price pressure and expressed concern about rising foreclosures and bank-owned properties coming to market. 
Single-family construction activity was at very low levels, but had improved somewhat in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts. Atlanta reported a softening of construction activity overall, and Minneapolis said single-family building activity was mixed across metros. Builders in the Dallas District said they had pulled back on starts considerably after the run-up earlier in the year. 
Respondents’ outlooks suggested sales and construction would remain subdued through year-end. There were some reports that tighter credit standards for buyers and small builders, along with general economic uncertainty, were stalling activity. 
Conditions in the commercial real estate sector remained subdued. Reports suggested rental rates continued to decline for most commercial property types. The one exception was the apartment sector, where higher leasing activity led to fewer concessions, most notably in Manhattan. Office, industrial and retail rental markets remained weak, although there were a few reports of slight increases in leasing activity in the Richmond, Chicago and Dallas Districts. Commercial property sales were low overall, but contacts in the Chicago and Dallas Districts said investment demand for distressed commercial properties remained strong. Given lackluster demand for commercial space, nonresidential construction activity was limited to mostly public projects, according to District reports. Industry contacts appeared to believe that the commercial real estate and construction sectors would remain weak for some time. 
Banking and Finance 
Lending activity was stable at low levels across most Districts, but there were some reports that demand picked up slightly. The Richmond and Dallas District reports noted increased lending activity, and Chicago said credit conditions continued to improve in the District. Reports from Richmond and Dallas suggested that competition for quality loans had picked up. Some contacts noted there was pressure to price loans slightly more aggressively. 
Demand for commercial and industrial loans remained weak as businesses continued to postpone capital spending plans because of economic and public policy uncertainties. However, merger and acquisition lending picked up in a few Districts. Commercial real estate lending remained subdued and loan standards were still tight. 
On the consumer side, lending was sluggish, but there were scattered reports of improvement. Contacts in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts reported growth in auto loans. Residential mortgage lending and refinancing activity increased in several Districts, and San Francisco reported an increase in demand for nonconforming mortgage loans. 
v 
Credit quality changed little on balance. New York reported a decrease in delinquency rates on consumer loans, however, and overall quality improved in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, according to reports. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural conditions were mostly favorable. Fall harvest was generally ahead of its normal pace, and above-average yields were expected in most reporting Districts. There were a few exceptions, however. Widespread rains flooded farmland and delayed harvests in the Minneapolis District while dry weather affected some crops in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts. Unfavorable weather conditions and resulting crop losses abroad continued to boost export demand for U.S. agricultural products. Commodity prices strengthened further, boosting optimism among producers in the Dallas District and spurring higher cropland values and capital spending on agricultural equipment in the Kansas City District. Additionally, corn producers in the Chicago District were holding on to recently harvested corn in hope of even higher prices. 
The energy sector continued to expand, with activity rising further in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. The Minneapolis District reported that mines were operating near capacity, and coal production was robust in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. Firms in the Dallas District noted strong domestic land-based drilling and a pickup in overseas demand had offset losses resulting from the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported that strong activity had prompted hiring and an increase in capital spending at some energy firms. Respondents’ outlooks were mostly positive, although low natural gas prices had dampened the outlook for producers in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts. 
Prices and Wages 
Input costs rose slightly, but prices of final goods and services were stable across Districts. Upward pressures on agricultural commodities and industrial metals prices were reported by several Districts. In addition, shipping costs increased in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts, and retailers in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts reported higher wholesale prices. Pass-through of rising input costs to final prices remained limited although there were scattered reports of increases. Prices of petrochemicals rose in the Dallas District, and a few manufacturers in the Boston District said recent price increases on some of their products had been successful. Some manufacturers in the Atlanta District noted rising costs of materials and employee benefits would likely be passed on to customers in the near-term, and several manufacturers in the Cleveland District announced plans to raise product prices in an attempt 
vi 
to recover rising costs. In response to rising food costs, food producers in the Dallas District reported plans to raise prices, and menu prices at restaurants rose modestly in the Kansas City District. 
Wage pressures remained minimal. Most District reports found little evidence of wage increases in general. There were widespread reports across Districts that firms anticipated increased costs of employee benefits as a result of healthcare reform. 
Hiring remained limited, with many firms reluctant to add to permanent payrolls given economic softness. Reports from staffing firms were mixed. Staffing firms in the New York and Dallas Districts noted a slowdown in demand for their services, and contacts in the Cleveland District said new job openings declined. Richmond’s report noted demand for temporary workers picked up slightly since the last report, and staffing contacts in the Philadelphia District said clients were adding positions as workloads increased. The Atlanta report noted a preference for increasing staff hours and using temporary help rather than hiring additional full-time staff.",1,1
2010-10-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested continued growth in national economic activity during the reporting period of mid-July through the end of August, but with widespread signs of a deceleration compared with preceding periods. Economic growth at a modest pace was the most common characterization of overall conditions, as provided by the five western Districts of St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The reports from Boston and Cleveland also pointed to positive developments or net improvements compared with the previous reporting period. However, the remaining Districts of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago all highlighted mixed conditions or deceleration in overall economic activity. 
Consumer spending appeared to increase on balance despite continued consumer caution that limited nonessential purchases, while activity in the travel and tourism sector picked up relative to seasonal norms. Activity was largely stable or up slightly for professional and other nonfinancial services. Reports on manufacturing activity pointed to further expansion, although the pace of growth eased according to several Districts. Agricultural producers and extractors of natural resources reported continued gains in demand and sales. Home sales slowed further following an initial drop after the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit at the end of June, prompting a slowdown in construction activity as well. Demand for commercial real estate remained quite weak but showed signs of stabilization in some areas. Reports from financial institutions pointed to generally stable or slightly lower loan demand and noted some modest improvements in credit quality. 
Upward price pressures remained quite limited for most categories of final goods and services, despite higher prices for selected commodities such as grains and some industrial materials. Wage pressures also were limited, although a few Districts noted increased upward pressures in a narrow set of sectors experiencing a mismatch between job requirements and applicant skills. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Reports on consumer spending were mixed but suggested a slight increase on balance. Most Districts reported that non-automotive retail sales rose compared with the previous reporting period or

ii 
were above their levels from 12 months earlier. By contrast, Atlanta reported a decline in the level of sales, and Richmond noted that sales “sputtered” in August, while New York and Dallas reported that growth in retail sales slowed. Several Districts noted an emphasis on necessities and lower-priced goods. Boston reported that back-to-school purchases were focused on immediate needs; in Cleveland, consumers focused on “value-priced seasonal items;” and in St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, sales were relatively stronger for lower-priced items. Spending on big-ticket items such as expensive consumer electronics was weak according to Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas. Most Districts also reported that sales of new automobiles and light trucks were largely stable or up slightly during the reporting period, and contacts were optimistic for stable sales or slight growth over the balance of the year. A few reports indicated that inventories for various goods remained near desired levels despite slower sales in some cases, as retailers have been practicing very tight inventory management. 
Reports from most Districts pointed to consistent gains in travel and tourist activity, with pickups evident in the business and leisure segments alike. New York reported strong tourist activity that kept hotel occupancy rates high in Manhattan despite an increase in hotel capacity this year, while Boston noted that travel and tourism activity was “stronger than expected.” Several other Districts also reported rising visitor counts and hotel occupancies, notably for popular tourist destinations in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, although several pointed to continued softness in per-visitor spending. Atlanta noted reduced tourist activity in areas of the Gulf Coast affected by the oil spill but improvements over last year in unaffected areas. Airline traffic was stable to up, with Boston pointing to an expanded number of low-fare carriers. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Activity was largely stable or up slightly for professional and other nonfinancial services. Providers of information technology (IT) services such as computer software saw substantial revenue and sales gains in the Boston and Kansas City Districts, with increased demand for IT labor reported in Chicago as well. Demand for professional services such as accounting held largely steady, with Minneapolis and Dallas noting increases for selected types of consulting and legal services. Conditions were mixed for providers of real estate services, as heightened appraisal activity for refinancing purposes was offset by depressed home sales and consequent limited needs for agents and brokers. Demand for temporary staffing services remained on an upward trend, with increases noted by Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis, although Chicago pointed to a slight softening during the reporting period. Reports from the health-care sector were mixed: Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago reported ongoing increases in demand for health-care workers, while Philadelphia indicated a flattening in demand for 
iii 
health-care services and San Francisco noted a decline in the frequency of elective procedures and routine tests. Demand for shipping and transportation services generally expanded, although according to Cleveland the pace of growth slowed and contacts there expect little change from existing volumes in the near term. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity expanded further on balance, although the pace of growth appeared to be slower than earlier in the year. Most Districts reported further gains in production activity and sales across a broad spectrum of manufacturing industries. However, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago noted that the overall pace of growth slowed, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported that demand softened compared with the previous reporting period. Recent weakness was most notable for construction-related products, according to reports from Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. By contrast, orders and activity edged up for makers of steel and other metals in Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis, propelled largely by demand from the transportation equipment industry. Activity among automobile makers and parts suppliers rose further in Richmond and held steady in Chicago, although it dropped temporarily in Cleveland as a result of factory retooling. Manufacturing activity for commercial aircraft was steady in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, although a contact in Boston reported that the industry’s recovery has been slow. In the Boston and San Francisco Districts, makers of semiconductors and other high-tech products saw further sales gains, while Dallas noted that demand held largely steady at existing high levels. Among nondurable products, food processing stepped up in Philadelphia and San Francisco. Demand conditions for paper products were mixed, with increased sales and expansion plans noted in Minneapolis and St. Louis but flat to declining sales identified in Dallas. Export demand was an important contributor to healthy conditions in the manufacturing sector according to Boston and Chicago, notably for heavy machinery and autos. 
Reports on capacity utilization were mixed. Manufacturers of high-tech products have been operating near maximum capacity of late, although this partly reflects a substantial decline in industry- wide capacity over the past three years, as noted by Dallas. More generally, the majority of Cleveland’s manufacturing contacts reported that capacity utilization remained below pre-recession levels. Capital spending plans for manufacturers and firms in other industries generally indicate little change or modest increases in coming months, based on reports from the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. 
Real Estate and Construction 
iv 
Activity in residential real estate markets declined further. Most District reports highlighted evidence of very low or declining home sales, which many attributed to a sustained lull following the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit at the end of June. Some Districts, such as New York and Dallas, noted that the expiration of the tax credit created especially weak conditions for lower-priced homes, while others, including Philadelphia and Kansas City, identified the high end of the market as the primary weak spot. Residential construction activity declined in most areas in response to weak demand. Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis were the exceptions to this pattern of declining activity, with reports from their contacts indicating that residential construction activity improved of late. Inventories of available homes rose in general, although the availability of new homes in Atlanta was held down by the slow pace of new home construction. Price movements were mixed, with most Districts reporting stability or declines of late; a few, notably Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, noted that prices rose in some areas compared with the previous reporting period or last year. Richmond reported that recent home sales were “dominated by foreclosure and short sales,” and Chicago reported an increase in the supply of foreclosed homes for sale. 
Demand for commercial, industrial, and retail space generally remained depressed. Vacancy rates stayed at elevated levels in general and rose further in a few Districts, placing substantial downward pressure on rents. Asking rents continued to decline in parts of the New York and Kansas City Districts. High vacancies and negative absorption held nonresidential construction activity to the bare minimum in most Districts. A few Districts reported exceptions to weak conditions. Cleveland noted improved construction activity for industrial use and educational infrastructure; this raised overall activity above year-earlier levels and prompted modest hiring by builders. Chicago reported an increase in inquiries for commercial redevelopment and rising construction activity for public projects, but Richmond reported that state and local governments cut back on construction projects. 
Banking and Finance 
Lending activity was stable to down slightly on net. Most Districts reported little or no change from existing low levels of commercial and industrial lending, as businesses remained quite cautious about expansion plans. Dallas and San Francisco reported that overall lending trailed off, with declines driven by weak business lending stemming in large part from uncertainty about future economic conditions. Consumer lending remained sluggish in general, with contacts in Philadelphia and Richmond emphasizing the role of households’ ongoing efforts to reduce their debt burdens. A recent flurry of refinancing activity spurred increased demand for residential mortgages in the New York, Cleveland, 
v 
Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, but new-purchase mortgage originations remained quite sluggish in general. A few Districts pointed to increases in nonbank financing activity, including rising availability of trade credit in Atlanta and further increases in venture capital funding in San Francisco. 
Lending standards were largely unchanged. However, New York reported tighter standards in all lending categories, particularly for commercial mortgages, and Kansas City reported that a few banks tightened standards for commercial real estate loans. By contrast, reports from Chicago indicated that credit availability and terms loosened for business and consumer loans. Credit quality also changed little on balance. Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco noted modest improvements in overall credit quality, while New York reported rising delinquencies for all categories except consumer loans and Atlanta reported an increase in business and household bankruptcies. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Demand for agricultural products continued to expand, and producers benefited from relatively tranquil supply conditions. Crops and livestock generally sold well in Districts with extensive agricultural sectors, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Domestic growers have seen increased demand for grains and other commodities as a result of shortages overseas. Growing conditions were supportive of relatively high yields in most areas, although volatile weather conditions held corn and soybean yields below the record levels expected earlier in the season in the Chicago District. Low moisture during parts of the growing season also undermined yields for selected crops in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, most notably for corn. 
Demand and extraction activity increased for producers of natural resource products, including oil and other items used for energy output. Rising global demand spurred expanded extraction activity for oil, natural gas, and assorted minerals, as reported by Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. In the Atlanta District, oil production was barely affected by the Gulf oil spill, although contacts noted lingering concerns about the longer-term business impacts of the deepwater drilling moratorium and higher liability insurance costs for oil extraction companies. 
Prices and Wages 
Upward price pressures were very limited during the reporting period, with the exception of selected food commodities and industrial materials. Philadelphia reported increases in the prices of primary metals and wood products, Minneapolis pointed to higher prices for copper and lead, and Dallas and San Francisco reported higher prices for grain and selected other agricultural commodities. Atlanta reported that commodity and transportation-related prices rose, but their contacts indicated plans to 
vi 
absorb the increases into their margins rather than passing them on to consumers. Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco also noted limited pass-through of cost pressures to downstream prices. 
Wage pressures remained modest overall. Of Districts commenting on wages, most identified little or no upward pressures or increases. Dallas reported that wage pressures were “generally nonexistent,” with the exceptions of some airline and temporary workers. Hiring of permanent employees was held down in part by employers’ reliance on temporary and contract workers, as reported by Philadelphia and Atlanta, although Boston noted that conversions from temporary to permanent staff picked up. Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts noted skill mismatches between available jobs and the workers applying for them, which caused a slight uptick in wage pressures for selected jobs in a narrow set of industries. More generally, however, the reports suggested ample supply of qualified applicants for open positions.",1,1
2010-08-31,"Economic activity has continued to increase, on balance, since the previous survey, although the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported that the level of economic activity generally held steady. Among those Districts reporting improvements in economic activity, a number of them noted that the increases were modest, and two Districts, Atlanta and Chicago, said that the pace of economic activity had slowed recently. 
Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most Districts, although several Districts reported that activity had slowed or leveled off during the reporting period. Districts also noted improved conditions in the services sector. The five Districts reporting on transportation noted increased activity. Tourism activity also increased across the Districts, although the Atlanta District noted concerns about decreased leisure travel to the Gulf Coast. Retail sales reports generally indicated a continued rise in spending, and several Districts noted that necessities continued to be strong sellers, while big-ticket items moved more slowly. However, most Districts that reported on auto sales noted declines in recent weeks. Activity in residential real estate markets was sluggish in most Districts after the expiration of the April 30 deadline for the homebuyer tax credit. Commercial real estate markets, especially construction, remained weak. Banking conditions varied across the Districts, with some Districts noting soft or decreased overall loan demand; credit standards remained tight in most reporting Districts. Recent rains had mixed effects on crop conditions, while activity in the natural resources sector increased. Overall labor market conditions improved modestly across the Districts, with several reports of temporary hiring. Consumer prices of goods and services held steady in most reporting Districts.

ii 
Input prices also held largely steady, with only a few reports of cost increases. Wage pressures continued to be contained on the whole. 
Manufacturing and Other Business Activity 
Manufacturing activity in most Districts continued to move up since the last report, although the pace of activity slowed or activity leveled off in the New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Chicago, Atlanta, and Richmond Districts. Automobile manufacturing was a bright spot for the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Automobile parts suppliers also experienced increased demand in both the Richmond and Chicago Districts. Fuel demand at refineries in the San Francisco District improved, while gasoline demand was steady in the Dallas District. Firms in the semiconductor manufacturing industry reported relatively strong sales or demand growth in both the Boston and San Francisco Districts. Firms in aircraft and parts manufacturing saw sales pick up in both the San Francisco and Dallas Districts. Manufacturing firms in the Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts were optimistic that demand would continue to improve in the following months. However, Cleveland’s contacts expect demand growth to taper off, Philadelphia noted that the balance of positive over negative views had narrowed, and Atlanta reported fewer firms planning expansions in production. Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas reported that firms in construction-related manufacturing experienced weak demand; construction supplies sales were flat in Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported that a firm in the sector was increasing production. Steel production declined in both the Chicago and Cleveland Districts. Some manufacturers in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts reported high excess production capacity. Capacity utilization was below pre-recession levels in Cleveland and edged lower among steel producers in Chicago. 
iii 
Activity in the services sector improved across most Districts since the previous report. The freight transportation industry experienced gains in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and Philadelphia Districts. Boston, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported a pickup in demand for some consulting firms. Tourism activity increased in the San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis, Richmond, Kansas City, and Atlanta Districts. Atlanta reported that leisure travel decreased in the Gulf Coast, but some of the lost tourist traffic was offset by the presence of cleanup crews, oil company workers, and the National Guard. Information technology firms saw increased business in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, while activity was flat in the Minneapolis District. Demand for healthcare services was flat in both the San Francisco and Richmond Districts, while activity increased in the Boston District. 
Consumer Spending 
Reports on retail sales during the early summer months were generally positive, although in most Districts the increases were modest. Retail sales in the New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts were higher than year-earlier sales, and Dallas reported solid gains. But sales in the Boston District were mixed compared with the previous year. Recent sales increased slightly in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts; sales in the Richmond District weakened; and sales in the Kansas City District were flat compared with the previous report. Several Districts cited apparel, food, and other necessities as recent strong sellers, while big-ticket items were weak sellers. Contacts reported satisfactory inventory levels in the New York District, mixed inventory levels in the Boston District, and low or declining inventory levels in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. The outlook for sales was mixed: Retailers in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported that they expect modest positive sales growth in the upcoming months; contacts in the 
iv 
Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported a less optimistic outlook going forward than in the previous report; and retailers in the Boston District reported a cautious outlook. 
The Districts that reported on auto sales during the early summer months generally noted a decrease in recent sales. Since the previous report, auto sales in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts declined, while auto sales in the Kansas City District increased and were unchanged in the Dallas District. Compared with last year, auto sales in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts were higher. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas all reported that inventory levels were low or declining. Auto dealers anticipate little change in sales for the rest of 2010 in the Philadelphia District and expect sales to increase slowly in the Dallas District. Contacts in the Kansas City District expect continued strong demand, while those in the Cleveland District do not anticipate strong growth in the coming months. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Nearly all Districts reported sluggish housing markets in the months since the homebuyer tax credit expired on April 30. While some Districts, such as Boston and St. Louis, reported an increase in May and June home sales on a year-over-year basis, some contacts noted that these sales may reflect closings of homes under contract by the April tax credit deadline. The Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts reported that home sales are expected to weaken going forward. Residential construction remained limited in several Districts. In the Atlanta District, residential construction activity softened from already weak levels. Homebuilders in the Cleveland District do not expect a turnaround in new home construction any time this year. Builders in the Chicago District are not introducing new inventory without a signed contract on a 
v 
home. Housing starts were expected to decline for the second half of the year in the Dallas District and to increase slightly over the next three months in the Kansas City District. 
Commercial and industrial real estate markets continued to struggle in all twelve Districts. Overall, vacancy rates were flat to slightly increased and continued to exert downward pressure on rents. Construction activity remained weak in most Districts. The New York District noted that commercial development remained generally sluggish despite some pickup in office and retail leasing in New York City. Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported that construction activity continued to be weak or to decline, and Cleveland reported that the increase in construction from previous reports has begun to diminish. Philadelphia reported that projects funded with federal stimulus support were near completion with no prospects for additional major construction, while Chicago reported that public infrastructure construction picked up. Developers reported difficult credit conditions in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts, while the Dallas District reported a few developers going out of business. The outlook for commercial and industrial real estate across the Districts ranged from further declines in activity to slow growth. 
Banking and Finance 
Reports on banking conditions were largely mixed across the Districts. Banking activity in Richmond and loan demand in Kansas City increased modestly. Overall loan demand was reported as soft or weak in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas, while total outstanding loan volume decreased in recent months in St. Louis but was steady in Philadelphia and San Francisco. Demand for commercial loans was flat to increasing in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts; in contrast, St. Louis reported a decrease in commercial 
vi 
loans outstanding, while New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported restrained or decreasing demand in this lending category. Demand for consumer loans was weak in Cleveland and eased in Philadelphia; Atlanta and St. Louis indicated a decline in consumer lending; but demand for consumer loans increased in New York and Kansas City. Demand for residential mortgage loans eased in the Philadelphia District but increased in the New York District; Cleveland reported residential mortgage activity below expectations at given rates; and real estate lending decreased in St. Louis. Credit was limited for commercial real estate loans in Chicago, and demand fell for these loans in New York and Kansas City. 
Most Districts reporting on credit standards continued to note that lending standards remain restrictive. New York reported tighter credit standards for all categories except consumer loans, while Kansas City reported tighter commercial lending standards. Reports on credit quality were mixed in Cleveland and Kansas City, while quality was stable in San Francisco. Credit quality improved slightly in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago. In the Dallas District, nonperforming loans have stabilized and are not expected to worsen. Meanwhile, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond continued to report delinquencies above historic norms. Delinquency rates in the New York District decreased for consumer loans but experienced little or no change in other categories. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Recent rains improved the dry conditions in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts and reduced irrigation needs in the Kansas City District. In contrast, excess precipitation caused some crop damage in the Chicago District and some delays in the winter wheat harvest in the Kansas City District. Parts of the Atlanta District experienced some crop stress due to dryness 
vii 
and heat. Contacts reported that crops were in good condition overall in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, but crop conditions worsened slightly in recent weeks in the Chicago District and were mixed in the St. Louis District compared with last year. Producers in the Chicago District continued to expect good yields for their corn and soybean crops, and the outlook for cotton yields in the Dallas District has improved. 
Overall, activity in the energy sector increased since the previous report. Oil production in the Atlanta District and oil and natural gas production in the Cleveland District were relatively unchanged, but other activity picked up throughout the Districts during the reporting period. The number of drilling rigs increased in the Dallas District, and production continued to expand in the Kansas City District. Additionally, oil exploration in the Minneapolis District and oil extraction in the San Francisco District increased. Activity in the Minneapolis District’s mining sector increased in recent weeks, as did production and demand for coal in the Cleveland District. Kansas City reported that contacts expect to see continued growth in energy production. 
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices 
Labor market conditions improved gradually in several Districts. New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Richmond, and Atlanta all reported that labor markets improved, albeit modestly in some cases, while Boston and Dallas reported that employment was steady. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported that temporary employment experienced increased demand. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts said that they continued to rely on temporary staff over permanent hires. Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago saw hiring in the manufacturing sector. Cleveland also reported some new job openings in the healthcare industry. Boston and Cleveland noted that firms in some services 
viii 
industries were hiring mostly for replacement. Dallas reported that firms in the energy industry experienced significant regional layoffs as a result of the deepwater drilling moratorium. San Francisco noted continued high levels of unemployment and limited hiring. 
Wage pressures remained largely contained across most Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported little or no change in wages, while Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City reported that wage pressures were small or remained subdued. Dallas reported that wage pressures were mostly nonexistent, with the exception of the airline industry. 
Prices of final goods and services were relatively stable in most Districts. Several Districts indicated that prices of raw materials also held steady, and only a few Districts reported input price increases. Steel prices moved slightly higher in the San Francisco District, but Cleveland and Chicago reported that steel prices were down. Chicago and San Francisco noted an increase in energy prices, but Atlanta reported that energy prices were mostly stable since the onset of the Gulf oil spill. Increased prices were noted for some metals by the Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Transportation costs increased in the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and the Richmond District noted that shipping lines were attempting to raise rates.",0,0
2010-07-31,"Economic activity continued to improve since the last report across all twelve Federal Reserve Districts, although many Districts described the pace of growth as “modest.” Consumer spending and tourism activity generally increased. Business spending also rose, on net, with employment and capital spending edging up but inventory investment slowing. By sector, nonfinancial services, manufacturing, and transportation continued to gradually improve. Residential real estate activity in many Districts was buoyed by the April deadline for the homebuyer tax credit. Commercial real estate remained weak, although some Districts reported an increase in leasing. Financial activity was little changed on balance, although a few Districts noted a modest increase in lending. Spring planting was generally ahead of the normal pace, while conditions in the natural resource sectors varied across the Districts. Prices of final goods and services were largely stable as higher input costs were not being passed along to customers and wage pressures continued to be minimal. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism. Consumer spending improved from the previous report. Spending continued to be concentrated in necessities as opposed to discretionary big-ticket items. Retail sales increased in April and May, although several Districts noted that the gains were uneven across months. Sales of spring and summer apparel were strong in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Sales of home improvement and lawn and garden equipment were reported to have strengthened in the Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Modest improvement in sales of discretionary home goods was noted by Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Vehicle sales also rose, but the rate of increase reportedly slowed in May in the New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts. Tourism activity improved. Dallas reported a continued increase in leisure air travel. Hotel occupancy rates rose in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, and convention activity increased in Atlanta and San Francisco. Richmond reported resort bookings for the Memorial Day holiday weekend were stronger than last year, and Atlanta indicated cruise-line bookings were up slightly. Atlanta also reported, however, that the Gulf oil spill and Tennessee

i 
floods had already resulted in some vacation lodging cancellations. The potential exists for a much greater impact, although contacts are quite uncertain as to the ultimate effects. 
Business Spending. Business spending increased moderately from the previous report. Cleveland, Chicago and Dallas noted that growth in manufacturers’ inventories was leveling off, while Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis reported the same for retailers’ inventories. In contrast, several Districts reported that auto production was failing to keep up with demand, pressuring already lean auto dealer stocks. Capital spending was slightly higher in a number of Districts, although several indicated that continuing caution on the part of firms and tight credit availability were limiting expenditures. The manufacturing, transportation, and energy industries accounted for most of the increase in spending on plant and equipment. Boston reported that spending on information technology services increased. 
Nonfinancial Services. Nonfinancial service activity was slightly improved, on balance, from the previous report. Several Districts highlighted some strength in demand for professional technical services, such as software and information technology, engineering, and other scientific trades. In contrast, sluggishness remained in accounting, legal, marketing, media, and construction services. Demand for business support services was more mixed. Philadelphia and Chicago reported slightly higher demand while Boston and St. Louis noted that demand remained weak. St. Louis also indicated that budget cuts had led to reduced government and education services. 
Manufacturing and Transportation. Manufacturing and transportation activity continued to gradually improve across all twelve Districts. Most Districts reported further increases in factory production, shipments, and new orders, although Philadelphia and Chicago noted that the pace of gains had slowed in May. Steel producers and metals manufacturers reported moderately higher production in Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas, although Chicago indicated capacity utilization leveled off in May. Auto and parts production increased in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. Oil refinery capacity utilization was up in the Dallas District. Higher residential construction increased demand for construction equipment and materials in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Chicago also noted that demand from Asia and South America for heavy equipment continued to be robust. The output of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals remained strong in Boston and Chicago, as did high-tech manufacturing in Boston, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Food 
ii 
processing increased in Dallas and San Francisco. Trucking and rail activity increased, with freight traffic and raw material shipments on the rise in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas. 
Real Estate and Construction. Residential real estate activity improved since the last report. Most Districts noted an increase in home sales and construction prior to the April 30th deadline for the homebuyer tax credit, with contacts in many of these Districts also indicating a corresponding slowing in activity in May. Tight credit, the elevated inventory of homes available for sale, and the “shadow inventory” of foreclosed properties on banks’ balance sheets held back residential development in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. Commercial real estate activity generally remained weak. Office, industrial, and retail vacancy rates continued to drift upward in many Districts putting downward pressure on rents. However, lower rents were said to have led to an increase in leasing activity in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The elevated inventory of existing properties for sale or rent continued to weigh on new private nonresidential construction. However, stronger industrial demand was noted in several Districts. Public construction increased in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago, but slowed in Minneapolis. 
Banking and Finance. Financial activity was little changed on balance from the previous report. Commercial and industrial lending by banks remained weak in most Districts, although Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco noted business loan demand was firming. Philadelphia also indicated an increase in business lending by non-depository financial companies, and New York reported that underwriting and investment banking activity strengthened. Consumer lending weakened in most Districts. In contrast, real estate lending increased even though standards on these loans remained tighter than on other loans, particularly for commercial mortgages. Chicago noted that the secondary market for residential mortgages was beginning to improve, and private equity investment in commercial properties increased in Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Loan quality was indicated to be stabilizing or gradually improving in most Districts, but remained an issue for banks with large exposures to real estate. Contacts in some Districts cited concerns over the potential impact of the European fiscal crisis on financial and business conditions, and reported a corresponding increase in uncertainty and financial market volatility. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Crop planting was generally ahead of the seasonal norm, particularly in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, although soybean planting 
iii 
was lagging in St. Louis and Kansas City. Crop emergence was also ahead of the typical pace. Precipitation conditions were generally positive, with the exception of flooding in Tennessee and dryness in parts of the Richmond and Dallas Districts. Prices for hogs, cattle, and cotton were higher, while prices for grains, soybeans, and milk were roughly unchanged. Mining and energy industry activity varied across Districts. According to contacts in the Atlanta District, the Gulf oil spill had little immediate effect on oil production, although it had damaged fishing operations. 
Employment, Wages, and Prices. Labor market conditions improved slightly with permanent employment levels edging up in most Districts. In addition, many Districts again noted an increase in temporary hires, with Boston and Dallas also indicating a pick up in temporary-to- permanent transitions. By industry, manufacturing was the most often cited source of employment gains (both temporary and permanent), and Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted an increase in the manufacturing workweek. Other sources of increased employment were the biopharmaceutical industry in Boston, retail trade in Chicago, and transportation in Dallas. 
Wage pressures were limited, although San Francisco noted upward pressure on employee benefit costs. Prices of final goods and services were largely unchanged in most Districts as higher input costs were not being passed along to customers and wage pressures continued to be minimal. Steel prices in many Districts moved higher, as did lumber and food prices, while energy prices generally declined. Several Districts noted tighter commodity supply conditions, with Richmond and Kansas City indicating an increase in supplier lead times and Boston and Atlanta reporting supply chain capacity constraints. Transportation costs moved up in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, but diesel fuel cost pressures eased in New York.",0,1
2010-05-31,"Overall economic activity increased somewhat since the last report across all Federal Reserve Districts except St. Louis, which reported “softened” economic conditions. Districts generally reported increases in retail sales and vehicle sales. Tourism spending was up in a number of Districts. Reports on the services sector were generally mixed. Manufacturing activity increased in all Districts except St. Louis, and new orders were up. Many Districts reported increased activity in housing markets from low levels. Commercial real estate market activity remained very weak in most Districts. Activity in the banking and finance sector was mixed in a number of Districts, as loan volumes and credit quality decreased. Agricultural conditions were mixed as well, with positive conditions reported in Districts from the central and western parts of the country, while negative conditions were reported in the mid and southern Atlantic Districts. Mining and energy production and exploration increased for metals, oil and wind. 
While labor markets generally remained weak, some hiring activity was evident, particularly for temporary staff. Wage pressures were characterized as minimal or contained. Retail prices generally remained level, but some input prices increased. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
District reports indicated that consumer spending increased during the reporting period. New York and Cleveland reported that recent sales strengthened, while sales rebounded in Richmond and Kansas City. Slight sales gains were reported in Philadelphia. Retail sales in San Francisco continued to improve, but remained somewhat sluggish on net. In St. Louis several new establishments opened, particularly in the food industry. Several Districts described consumers as somewhat more confident. Businesses were cautiously optimistic regarding future sales: Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas noted that retailers expect sales to improve during the upcoming months. Sales of home furnishings and electronic goods increased in a number of Districts, while seasonal apparel sales were up in New York, Philadelphia and Kansas City. New York and Minneapolis noted that shopping by Canadians was strong at businesses near the border. Atlanta reported that retailers continued to keep inventory levels lower than normal, and retailers in New York reported that inventories are in very good shape. 
* Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before April 5, 2010. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
Vehicle sales improved in a number of Districts during March. New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco noted that auto sales picked up in recent weeks. Cleveland described sales as decent, while sales were steady in Kansas City and mixed in Richmond. Several Districts noted that favorable pricing and credit terms helped lure buyers into showrooms. Dealers in Philadelphia indicated that they expect sales to increase during the next few months. 
Tourism conditions also improved during the reporting period. New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco pointed to signs of increased tourism activity. Tourism was described as stable in most parts of the Atlanta District. Hotel occupancy rates were rising in New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Reports on room rates were mixed: New York and Kansas City noted increases, while Chicago reported rate cuts, particularly at luxury hotels. Managers at mountain resorts in the Richmond District reported that this winter was one of their best ski seasons ever. However, Atlanta noted that corporate bookings remained at very low levels at some high-end resorts. Nonfinancial Services Business services were mixed, with some signs of economic recovery. Boston and Minneapolis reported increased activity. Richmond and Dallas were mixed, while San Francisco said demand remained lackluster. St. Louis reported that the sector continued to decline. Advertising and consulting firms in Boston said demand is up substantially from the first quarter of 2009, while an advertising contact in Richmond and professional media services firms in San Francisco characterized sales as flat at low levels. Dallas reported sluggish demand for nontax-related accounting and legal services. Law firms in Minneapolis specializing in debt collections and bankruptcy saw strong demand, while a Richmond property manager noted a large number of repossessions. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity increased since the last report across most of the country, with all Districts other than St. Louis reporting increases in orders, shipments, or production. Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco reported positive results in metals and fabrication. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Chicago reported increased auto or auto component production. Boston, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco saw increased production in electronic, computers or high-technology goods. Chicago and Minneapolis 
iii 
saw increased production of energy-related products. However, for construction-related goods, Chicago and Dallas reported mixed conditions, Boston reported flat activity and St. Louis reported decreases. Overall, St. Louis saw more plant closures than plant openings. 
Banking and Finance 
Bank lending activity was mixed by category in most Districts. Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City saw weaker loan demand across categories, while activity in San Francisco was flat at low levels and Dallas said that demand appears to be stabilizing. Demand for consumer credit decreased in New York and increased slightly in Philadelphia. Most banks in Cleveland reported weak consumer loan demand, although a few contacts saw a slight increase due to seasonal factors. Business and industrial loan volumes decreased in Philadelphia, Cleveland and Chicago and were flat in New York. San Francisco noted continued modest gains in venture capital funding. 
Credit standards remained generally unchanged across the nation, while credit quality was mixed. New York, Cleveland and Kansas City reported tighter lending standards for commercial mortgages. In Atlanta several business contacts reported difficulty getting credit. Dallas and San Francisco said standards continued to be tight. New York saw increased delinquency rates for all categories except consumer loans, which were flat. Philadelphia and Richmond saw little change in credit quality, while Cleveland was mixed. Dallas reported that credit quality was either stabilizing or improving, and appeared to have turned a corner. Chicago noted an improvement in consumer and business loan quality, although credit quality for many small firms continued to decline. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity increased, albeit from low levels, in most Districts, with the exceptions of St. Louis, where it was mixed, and San Francisco, where it was flat. Contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland and Kansas City expressed concern about whether sales would continue to grow after the expiration of the first-time home buyer tax credit. New York, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco noted sluggish sales for high-end homes. Home prices were stable across most Districts, but decreased in parts of the New York and Atlanta Districts. Residential construction activity increased slightly in New 
iv 
York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Dallas, but remained weak in Cleveland, Chicago and San Francisco. 
Commercial real estate activity was slow across the nation. Notable exceptions were Richmond, which saw an uptick in commercial leasing, and Dallas, where the sector was mixed and might be nearing bottom. In Boston, leasing activity consists largely of renewals, with many renewing tenants leasing less space. Manhattan Class A office rents were down 20 percent to 25 percent year over year. Contacts in Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City and Dallas expressed concern that lease concessions from landlords were putting downward pressure on rents. Commercial construction continued to be weak in most Districts. Cleveland saw some development in the energy and industrial segments. Agriculture and Natural Resources Districts reported mixed results in agriculture. Atlanta reported that cold weather negatively affected crop conditions. Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas noted that wet conditions delayed planting, though Dallas also commented that current soil moisture levels will be beneficial for the growing season. Chicago expected a normal planting schedule. Minneapolis and San Francisco indicated favorable weather conditions. The calving season is doing well in the Minneapolis District, but Chicago and Minneapolis noted softening dairy output prices. 
Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since the last report. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco saw increases in oil exploration. Coal production was mixed in the Philadelphia District and increased in the Kansas City District. In the Minneapolis District, more wind energy projects are planned, and mining activity increased. Employment, Wages, and Prices While overall labor markets remained weak, some hiring activity was evident, particularly for temporary staff. Employment in the manufacturing and services sectors in Boston remained relatively unchanged, while very little hiring occurred at major legal and financial firms in New York. In the Richmond District, job cuts subsided at retail businesses, and employment was stable at most other services firms. In Kansas City overall employment levels held steady, but more manufacturers and several energy- related firms planned to increase payrolls. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago reported strong demand for temporary workers. A pickup in employment was noted in the 
v 
manufacturing sector by Cleveland, with little change in staffing for retail, energy, transportation and banking. Atlanta noted that many businesses continued to increase hours worked for existing staff. Minneapolis reported that while labor markets remained weak, some signs of hiring were noted. 
Wage pressures were characterized as minimal or contained. In Boston, most firms reported instituting or planning to institute modest wage increases of 2 percent to 3 percent in 2010, while performance bonuses in the services sector were generally down. Richmond reported that average wages edged higher in March in the services sector, but declined slightly in manufacturing. Most companies hiring new workers in the Kansas City District were not offering higher salaries to attract qualified applicants. Dallas reported that just a handful of firms were planning on partially reinstating employer matches to retirement plans or giving small pay increases. In Chicago wage pressures were minimal; however, an increase in health-care costs was noted. San Francisco also reported significant increases in the costs of employee benefits, such as health insurance and pensions. 
Retail prices generally remained level, but some input prices increased. Where producers faced cost pressures on inputs, they were largely unable to pass those prices downstream to selling prices, although in Kansas City some manufacturers were considering raising selling prices due to higher raw materials costs. In Boston retail vendor and selling prices were stable. Philadelphia reported that prices of most goods and services have been steady, although there were increased reports of rising prices for basic materials and construction-related products. Apart from rising prices for steel and petroleum-based products in Cleveland, raw materials and product pricing were generally stable. Richmond noted moderate price increases in the manufacturing and services sectors. Chicago reported upward pressure on prices for plywood, industrial metals and petroleum-based fuels. In the Dallas District prices of chemicals and related products rose sharply, primarily due to plant outages. Natural gas prices slipped during the reporting period because of continued high levels of production, low industrial demand and the end of the winter season. Richmond and San Francisco reported increased overseas shipping costs.",0,0
2010-04-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic conditions continued to expand since the last report, although severe snowstorms in early February held back activity in several Districts. Nine Districts reported that economic activity improved, but in most cases the increases were modest. Overall conditions were described as mixed in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, though St. Louis noted further signs of improvement in some areas. Richmond reported that economic activity slackened or remained soft across most sectors, due importantly to especially severe February weather in that region. 
Consumer spending improved slightly in many Districts since the last survey, but severe snowstorms in early February limited activity in some Districts. Tourist activity was reported as increased or mixed, with some improvement in hotel occupancies. The demand for services was generally positive across Districts, most notably for health-care and information technology firms. Of the five Districts reporting on transportation, three characterized activity as improved over the previous survey. Manufacturing activity strengthened in most regions, particularly in the high-tech equipment, automobile, and metal industries. Residential real estate markets improved in a number of Districts, although several Districts noted that activity softened or remained weak partly due to extreme winter weather. Most Districts characterized commercial real estate and construction activity as weak or having declined further, but some Districts noted slight stabilization and a few signs of modest improvement. Loan demand remained weak, and lending standards remained tight across the country. Harsh weather continued to negatively

affect agricultural activity, although some Districts reported favorable crop conditions. Districts reporting on energy activity said it continued to strengthen, particularly drilling for natural gas. 
Price pressures were mostly limited, with the exception of some increases in raw materials prices. Even with input costs rising, selling prices remained stable due to competitive pressures and limited pricing power. Although some Districts reported an uptick in hiring or a slowdown in layoffs, labor markets generally remained soft throughout the nation, which resulted in minimal wage pressures. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending showed signs of improvement in many Districts since the last report but was hampered in several regions by severe weather conditions in early February. Retail sales improved in the Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and New York said sales were well above year-ago levels in January and met expectations in February despite inclement weather. Philadelphia also reported that sales were moving up slowly until snowstorms hit in February. Boston and Cleveland characterized sales as mixed but slightly higher overall than year ago levels. Sales were lower than expected in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts and were down from year-ago levels in the St. Louis District. Several Districts reported that sales were strongest for lower-priced items, while sales of luxury and big ticket items remained sluggish. However, San Francisco noted scattered reports of increased discretionary spending, and Cleveland said some retailers noted a broader, if still slight, increase in demand across a variety of products. Inventories were being managed carefully and held at fairly low levels in most Districts, but Chicago said rising sales were leading retailers to begin rebuilding inventories from low levels. 
iii 
Auto sales were generally reported as flat or down, with a few Districts again noting that some of the sluggishness was likely due to poor weather conditions. New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco all noted some softening in new auto sales, though New York cited brisk sales of used vehicles. Chicago and Kansas City also reported declining auto sales, while Dallas noted some seasonal softness and Atlanta said sales remained weak. Some Districts reported modest improvement in auto credit conditions. Cleveland noted that many consumers remain reliant on manufacturers’ incentives, and auto dealers in the Chicago District blamed part of their recent sales decline on reduced factory incentives. 
Districts reporting on tourism said that activity was either rising or mixed since the last survey period. Ski resorts in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts reported at least modest rebounds in activity from year-ago levels, while Minneapolis characterized skier visits to a Montana resort as flat. New York said hotel occupancies in Manhattan were up considerably from a year ago in January and Broadway theatre activity was robust before falling off due to weather in February. Atlanta also reported rising tourism activity related to several successful major sporting events and a well-attended Mardi Gras in New Orleans. San Francisco noted increases in visitors to Hawaii and Las Vegas and said hotel occupancies stabilized in some other areas. Nonfinancial Services 
Nonfinancial services activity was reported as steady or improved by the majority of Districts. Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported generally solid demand in health-care services, although Minneapolis noted continued weakness in elective procedures. New York indicated that a growing number of service firms planned to increase capital spending in the months ahead, but investment expectations diminished among high-tech companies in the 
iv 
Kansas City District. Richmond reported that service revenues fell due to the record snowstorms, but a few contacts saw a slight pickup in demand, particularly architectural firms, hospitals, and financial service professionals. 
In transportation services, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City reported an improvement in activity since the last survey, while Dallas said activity was mixed and St. Louis noted large job cuts in the industry. Regional rail loadings were above year-ago levels in the Atlanta District, especially for autos, chemicals, metals, and some construction-related equipment. Intermodal firms in the Dallas District reported no change in cargo volumes, with a rise in exports being offset by a decline in imports. Although shipping volumes increased, Cleveland noted that margins remained depressed due to over-capacity issues, limiting investment in new trucks. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity increased further in most Districts, although Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized overall activity as flat or mixed. Philadelphia reported widespread production increases across most industries, and manufacturers in the Cleveland District reported a general rise in capacity utilization. Many Districts reported strong production in metals, and the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted strength in high-tech equipment, particularly semiconductors. Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas noted solid improvements in auto-related manufacturing. A consumer goods company in the Boston District said European sales were at healthier levels. Contacts in the Chicago District reported strong growth in Asian exports but remained concerned about China’s underlying economic strength. Dallas reported that exports for natural-gas based products remained strong, but weak demand for refined products has trimmed margins and cut capacity utilization further. Construction- 
v 
related activity remained weak in the Chicago and Dallas Districts, and new orders for commercial aircraft and parts were sluggish in the San Francisco District. Philadelphia and Richmond noted productions delays due to the winter snowstorms in February, but some factories were able to make up the losses with longer work hours and extended shifts. Several manufacturers in the Philadelphia District said production gains could be limited due to continued tightening in credit markets and adverse developments in taxes and regulations. Plant managers in a few Districts reported that a large number of customers were simply restocking inventories, leading to concerns about the sustainability of the increase. However, contacts in most Districts remained optimistic for future months, with several reports of planned increases in capital spending. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate markets improved in a number of Districts, remained weak or softened further in the New York, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts, was little changed in the San Francisco District, and characterized as mixed in the St. Louis District. Richmond also reported overall housing activity as mixed, but one contact noted that absent the harsh weather, market conditions might have improved. Adverse weather conditions also hampered home sales and construction in the New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta Districts. Most Districts attributed stronger home sales to the home-buyer tax credit, with several contacts apprehensive about future sales once the credit expires on April 30. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that sales were strongest for low-priced and starter homes, while Dallas cited financing difficulties for high-end homes. Home construction was down or stagnant in most Districts, with the exception of the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Atlanta said the most pronounced weakness was among Georgia homebuilders, and San Francisco attributed 
vi 
weak construction activity to elevated home inventory levels. Home prices mostly remained flat or declined slightly, but signs of improvement were noted in the Boston and San Francisco Districts. A real estate agent in a relatively upscale area of the New York District said prices have continued to drift downward but that short sales were relatively rare and most transactions were still above the mortgage balance. 
Commercial real estate conditions remained weak or declined further in most Districts, although some Districts noted slight stabilization or modest signs of improvement. Commercial real estate activity weakened in the Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, though Dallas noted that leasing fell at a slower rate and San Francisco cited increased leasing in some segments. Boston and Philadelphia said conditions remain weak, but both noted some improvement in sales of commercial space. New York reported softer activity in the New York City area but some steadying in vacancies and rents elsewhere, while St. Louis said activity remained weak throughout the District. Several Districts also noted that many tenants were pushing for, and in some cases receiving, concessions on rents. All Districts reporting on commercial construction said that activity remained weak or slow, except for some moderate boost from federal stimulus projects and other public construction. Credit for commercial development and transactions was still very difficult to obtain in several Districts, though San Francisco noted a slight improvement in financing availability. Banking and Finance 
Loan demand remained weak across the country. New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported decreased demand for most types of loans. Other Districts said loan demand was unchanged but soft. Richmond and Chicago noted that the weak economic outlook was holding back loan demand, and San Francisco said caution about hiring and spending plans was keeping 
vii 
businesses from seeking credit. However, Philadelphia and Richmond reported banks were receiving more inquiries from businesses about loans, and Dallas said contacts were hopeful that loan demand would pick up by the end of the year. 
Most Districts indicated that banks remained cautious about lending. New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported somewhat tighter credit standards on commercial real estate loans, and New York noted tighter standards for commercial and industrial loans. In other Districts, credit standards were little changed but remained tight. Atlanta reported that banks had ample liquidity but were reluctant to reduce cash reserves. Chicago said a leveling in asset quality was causing large banks to become more interested in lending to prime borrowers, but strained balance sheets were holding back lending by mid-size banks. In the Dallas District, smaller banks reported that regulatory requirements were limiting their ability to expand real estate lending. Loan quality remained a concern but showed signs of stabilizing in some Districts. New York, Dallas, and San Francisco cited further declines in loan quality. In addition, banks in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts were reported to be slightly less pessimistic about future loan quality than in the previous survey. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Harsh winter weather continued to dampen overall agricultural activity, although crop conditions were still generally favorable in most Districts. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that livestock were stressed by severe weather and that producers provided supplemental feed due to poor grazing conditions. Atlanta commented that cold temperatures caused minor freeze damage to vegetable and citrus crops. Despite below-average temperatures, Kansas City reported the winter wheat crop was in generally good condition. Dallas and San Francisco said that heavy rains and snowfall improved soil moisture for this year’s crop 
viii 
production, though some contacts were concerned that spring planting could be delayed if fields remain too wet. Crop prices edged down following the bumper fall harvest, but Chicago noted that high-quality grain was selling at a premium, due in part to strong export demand. Hog and cattle prices strengthened and dairy prices were flat. Kansas City noted stronger farm incomes from crop production, while agricultural lenders in the Minneapolis District expected farm income and spending to decrease. 
Energy activity generally strengthened since the last survey period. Kansas City and Dallas reported increased drilling activity, especially for natural gas, and Cleveland noted increased natural gas-related investment. However, producers in the Kansas City District were concerned that a boost in supply from shale gas production could lower natural gas prices later in the year. Minneapolis reported that oil exploration expanded in February, while oil production was stable in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts. Coal production in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts remained below year-ago levels. Minneapolis reported brisk activity in metal mining and continued energy construction. Employment, Wages, and Prices 
The pace of layoffs slowed in most Districts, but hiring plans still remained generally soft. New York cited a slowdown in layoffs at a securities firm and noted a pickup in hiring in whatwasstillcharacterizedasanexceptionallyweaklegalindustry. StaffingfirmsintheBoston District also saw a strengthening in demand, particularly from the financial and manufacturing sectors. Several manufacturing and construction firms in the Cleveland District began recalling workers, and temporary staffing accelerated in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. However, Chicago said demand for permanent workers was low, and a manufacturing contact in the Richmond District held back employment due to productivity improvements. Layoffs were 
ix 
also reported at several retail and manufacturing firms in the Dallas District, and Minneapolis said companies in the medical insurance and financial services industries reduced employment. Wage pressures were minimal, but Boston and Cleveland noted a lift in salary freezes and Richmond said wages rose at service and retail businesses. 
The majority of Districts reported limited price pressures, although several noted rising input costs due to higher commodities prices. Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas noted an increase in metals prices, particularly steel, and Chicago and Kansas City said the upward pressure on some raw materials prices was likely to continue. Lumber prices rose in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts due in large part to weather-related supply issues. On the other hand, San Francisco reported commodity prices were stable or down, with declines in natural gas, copper, and aluminum prices. Some contacts in the Boston District said customers sought fewer price concessions from vendors in order to better ensure reliable deliveries. But nearly all Districts reported limited pricing power, with many firms unable to increase selling prices due to competitive pressure. Retail prices were stable in most Districts, although San Francisco noted heavy discounting. Districts generally expected stable prices overall heading forward.",0,1
2010-02-28,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that while economic activity remains at a low level, conditions have improved modestly further, and those improvements are broader geographically than in the last report. Ten Districts reported some increased activity or improvement in conditions, while the remaining two— Philadelphia and Richmond—reported mixed conditions. The last Beige Book reported eight Districts with increased activity or improving conditions and four Districts showing little change and/or mixed conditions. 
Most Districts reported that consumer spending in the recent 2009 holiday season was slightly greater than in 2008, but still far below 2007 levels. Retail inventory levels remain very lean in nearly all Districts. Auto sales held steady or increased slightly since the last Beige Book in most Districts. Reports on tourism were mostly flat or weak, but for two Districts whose ski resorts enjoyed early season snowstorms. Nonfinancial services activity generally improved in Districts that reported on this sector. Of five Districts reporting transportation services, volumes were slightly up or mixed. Manufacturing activity has increased or held steady since the last report in most Districts. Among Districts reporting on near-term expectations, the manufacturing outlook was optimistic, but spending plans remain cautious. 
Toward the end of 2009, home sales increased in most Districts, especially for lower-priced homes. Home prices appeared to have changed little since the last Beige Book, and residential construction remained at low levels in most Districts. Commercial

ii 
real estate was still weak in nearly all Districts with rising vacancy rates and falling rents. Since the last report, loan demand continued to decline or remained weak in most Districts, while credit quality continued to deteriorate. Cold weather at the end of the year adversely affected some late crops and stressed livestock, but above-average yields for early crops were reported by some Districts. Energy-related production has risen moderately since the last Beige Book. 
Although some hiring was reported in a few Federal Reserve Districts, labor market conditions remained generally weak with modest wage increases appearing in just a few Districts. Price pressures remained subdued in nearly all Districts, though increases in metals prices were reported and agricultural prices have been mixed. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending in the recent 2009 holiday season was modestly greater than in 2008 for eight Districts, although as retailers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts noted, 2008 sales were so low compared with 2007, that the relatively small 2009 gains did not represent a significant shift in trend. Consumers were variously described as cautious, price sensitive, and focused on necessities, but sometimes willing to spend on discretionary purchases. Kansas City and New York reported holiday sales comparable to prior year sales, while Cleveland and Richmond reported weaker holiday sales in 2009 than in 2008. Entering the holiday period, retail inventories were maintained or lowered further to lean levels in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York Districts. Some Chicago retailers reported running out of high-demand items during the holiday season, but inventory levels rose slightly in the Kansas City District. 
iii 
Auto sales were flat or up slightly for some dealers since the last Beige Book in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Districts. Dealer incentives boosted year-end inventory clearance according to Chicago District contacts. In the Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, and San Francisco Districts auto sales held steady or were mixed across states. The Kansas City and Richmond Districts reported lower auto sales since the last report. Some dealers in the Cleveland and New York Districts cited difficulties securing floor-plan financing. Difficulties securing customer financing was a concern cited by some Kansas City District dealers, while Philadelphia District dealers credited easier financing for supporting their recent sales. 
Early-season snowstorms gave ski resorts a big lift in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts; otherwise travel and tourism reports were mostly flat or weak in these and other Districts. One Minnesota-based travel services firm shut down due to lack of demand, and Richmond’s tourism contacts reported consumers searching for deeply discounted packages and dining out less despite special offers. The New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts also reported flat or weaker tourism. New York City’s Broadway theaters reported weaker attendance this past holiday season than in 2008. Atlanta reported sluggish tourism throughout their District, but expected a boost from hosting upcoming National Football League events, and from strong 2010 cruise line bookings—a result of deep discounting. Kansas City and San Francisco noted sluggish business travel, placing downward pressure on airline passenger volumes, while Dallas reported airline demand recovering and fares stabilizing. The San Francisco District reported greater visitor volumes in Hawaii and Las Vegas, while occupancy rates in Seattle and Southern California were down. 
iv 
Nonfinancial Services 
Districts reporting on nonfinancial services generally indicated an upward trend in activity, although in some areas reports were mixed. Boston reported widespread positive activity in advertising, consulting, private equity firms, healthcare, biotechnology, education, and government services. High-tech service firms reported favorable conditions in Kansas City. New York reported a general pickup in activity. Health care providers reported increased demand in the San Francisco District, while professional services, especially advertising and accounting weakened. The Minneapolis District also reported mixed results across sectors, while activity in the Richmond District was generally down. Hiring through staffing firms was reported up in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas with office and health care workers in greatest demand. Direct firm hiring was reported up in the St. Louis District, flat in Dallas, flat to down in New York, and down in Richmond. 
Among the five Districts reporting on transportation services, activity was mostly up slightly, or mixed. Freight shipping volumes were up slightly in the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Dallas Districts, while Kansas City reported a slight slowdown in activity. The Richmond District’s port activity gained from increased international trade, especially imports of high-end vehicles, but intermodal firms in the Dallas District reported that imports dropped and exports flattened producing no increase in cargo volumes. Dallas also reported continued declines in rail cargo volume. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity has improved since the last report in six Districts. New York reported a general pickup in activity, broad optimism, and some increase in 
v 
employment. Production was stable or slightly up in the Cleveland District. Firms in the Cleveland District expect greater export opportunities going forward, but steel firms expect slow growth in overall demand. Manufacturers in the Chicago District cited gains at firms tied to the auto industry and those benefiting from an increase in exports to Asia. Firms in the Boston District also cited Asian exports as well as defense work as sources of their positive demand, but identified weak demand for exports to Europe and for products related to energy sectors and commercial construction. San Francisco reported a modest net improvement in manufacturing activity, with semiconductors strengthening and aircraft and parts stabilizing at moderate levels. Metal fabricators and housing products have also stabilized, but at very low levels. 
Three Districts reported mixed results for manufacturing. Food products, furniture, and chemical firms reported slight increases in the Philadelphia District while other manufacturing sectors continued to decline. Dallas reported strength in high-tech and corrugated packaging, seasonal increases in food producers, little change in fabricated metals and petrochemicals, seasonal decreases in aircraft components, and weaknesses in emergency vehicles and construction-related manufacturing. The Minneapolis District reported manufacturing activity up in Minnesota, but down in the Dakotas based on a recent survey of new orders. 
Manufacturing activity was weak in the other Districts. Richmond reported widespread weakness across shipments, new orders, and employment within its manufacturing sector and Atlanta saw orders and production drop back after an increase in November. The St. Louis District reported a continued decline in activity, persistent weakness in employment, and plant closings, on net. 
vi 
Manufacturers’ expectations for the near future as reported from the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and Philadelphia Districts were all optimistic, although Kansas City firms were less optimistic than the last report. Capital spending plans remained more cautious. Only Boston and Philadelphia reported that firms were planning to increase capital spending in the current year. Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City reported expectations of continued modest spending. Real Estate and Construction 
Homes sales increased toward the end of 2009 in most Federal Reserve Districts, except San Francisco, where demand for housing has been steady, and Kansas City, where residential real estate activity has eased since the last Beige Book. In New York, Richmond, and Atlanta, residential real estate activity was described as mixed across areas of the District. In the Atlanta District, existing home sales increased, but new home sales decreased. In all Districts, sales of lower-priced homes tended to increase proportionately more than sales of higher-priced homes, due at least in part to the first- time buyer federal tax credit, according to real estate contacts. In several Districts real estate contacts reported that the original expiration date for the credit boosted sales in November and led to a more than usual slowdown in sales in December. However, some contacts noted that the extension of the credit into 2010 could give an added impetus to the expected seasonal sales upturn this spring. Residential construction activity remained at low levels in most Districts, although home building was reported to have increased in the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts. Home prices appeared to have changed little since the last Beige Book, overall. Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland reported declines in 
vii 
home prices since the last Beige Book. Richmond reported nearly steady prices. Dallas reported some firming in prices. 
Nonresidential real estate conditions remained soft in nearly all Districts. New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported further weakening in demand for commercial and industrial space. Boston received mixed reports on sales and leasing activity from commercial real estate contacts in the District, and Minneapolis reported some increases in sales of commercial buildings. Richmond reported that sales of nonresidential properties remained slow, but that leasing of office and retail space has picked up. Vacancy rates were rising and rents were declining in most Districts. Several Districts reported that landlords were focused on tenant retention and that slack demand was allowing tenants to negotiate lease extensions at low rents and with favorable allowances. San Francisco reported that lower rents appeared to be supporting an upturn in leasing in some parts of that District, although vacancy rates continued to rise. Nonresidential construction activity was generally weak in all Districts, although St. Louis reported some gains in construction of education facilities and Cleveland reported a recent increase in nonresidential contracting. Banking and Finance 
Loan demand continued to decline or remained weak in most Districts. St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted general declines or soft loan demand. New York reported declining demand for all types of loans except residential mortgages for which demand has been steady. Philadelphia reported continuing declines for all categories of credit. Cleveland noted declining demand for business loans and underutilization of commercial credit lines. Richmond reported that commercial and 
viii 
industrial loan demand was steady to slightly up since the last Beige Book but still down year-to-year. Chicago noted low utilization of commercial credit lines but an uptick in financing of mergers and acquisitions. Other recent increases were reported for mortgage refinancing in the Atlanta District and auto loans in the Chicago District. San Francisco noted a small improvement in venture capital financing and initial public offerings. 
A number of Districts reported that credit quality continued to deteriorate. Financial institutions in the New York District reported ongoing increases in delinquencies for all types of loans. Banks in the Philadelphia District reported that delinquencies and defaults continued to rise for all types of loans, although less sharply than at the time of the previous Beige Book. Cleveland received reports of steady consumer credit quality but high and rising commercial loan delinquencies. Kansas City noted year-over-year declines in credit quality among financial institutions in the District, and Dallas and San Francisco reported continued deterioration at financial institutions in their Districts. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Federal Reserve District Banks reporting on agricultural conditions generally indicated that cold weather at the turn of the year had adversely affected crops and stressed livestock. Atlanta noted damage to citrus crops from the cold, and Chicago and Minneapolis reported that winter storms halted corn harvesting, and impeded tillage and fertilizer application. However, Dallas reported that rain improved soil conditions after a dry period in that District. Corn and soybean crop yields before the onset of cold weather and storms were described as above average in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Kansas City also reported that the winter wheat crop was progressing normally. San 
ix 
Francisco reported an increase in sales of agricultural products, with a boost from a rise in demand from foreign countries. Agricultural prices have been mixed. Grain and soybean prices were mostly on the rise, according to reports from Chicago and Kansas City. Chicago also reported increased prices for milk and hogs, but a decline in cattle prices. 
Production of energy-related materials has risen moderately since the last Beige Book. Atlanta reported that oil production has continued to increase. Minneapolis reported an increase in oil and gas exploration, and Kansas City and Dallas reported increases in drilling. San Francisco noted an increase in extraction of natural gas but a continued low rate of oil extraction. In contrast to generally rising oil and gas production, coal production was reported to have declined by Cleveland and St. Louis, and falling iron mining activity was reported by Minneapolis. Employment, Wages and Prices 
Labor market conditions remained soft in most Federal Reserve Districts, although New York reported a modest pickup in hiring and St. Louis reported that several service-sector firms in that District recently announced plans to hire new workers. In the Richmond District, temporary employment agencies gave mixed reports, but some noted increased demand for administrative and sales workers, laborers, and warehousing and distribution workers. Wage pressures remained subdued in most Federal Reserve Districts, and Atlanta noted continued wage freezes at some employers in that District. However, Boston reported some modest pay increases, and Minneapolis indicated that wages in that District have been level or rising moderately. 
x 
Price pressures remained subdued in nearly all Federal Reserve Districts, although increases in metals prices were noted in Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Raw materials prices, other than metals, were reported to be mostly steady, although firms in the New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago Districts noted some increases in the cost of the inputs they use. Agricultural commodity prices were reported on the increase by Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Most Districts reported that retail prices have been steady.",0,0
2009-11-30,"Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated either stabilization or modest improvements in many sectors since the last report, albeit often from depressed levels. Leading the more positive sector reports among Districts were residential real estate and manufacturing, both of which continued a pattern of improvement that emerged over the summer. Reports on consumer spending and nonfinancial services were mixed. Commercial real estate was reported to be one of the weakest sectors, although reports of weakness or moderate decline were frequently noted in other sectors. 
Reports of gains in economic activity generally outnumber declines, but virtually every reference to improvement was qualified as either small or scattered. For example, Dallas cited slight improvements residential real estate and staffing firms, while New York noted gains only in a few sectors (predominantly manufacturing and retail). Retail and manufacturing conditions were mixed in Boston, but some signs of improvement were reported. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco cited small pickups in manufacturing activity. In the Kansas City District, an uptick was noted in technology firms, while services firms posted revenue gains in Richmond. However, conditions were referred to as stable or flat for business services and tourism firms in Minneapolis and agriculture in St. Louis and Kansas City. 
The weakest sector was commercial real estate, with conditions described as either weak or deteriorating across all Districts. Banking also faltered in several Districts, with Kansas City and San Francisco noting continued erosion in credit quality (often with more expected in the future). One bright spot in the banking sector was lending to new homebuyers, in response to the first-time homebuyer tax credit. Finally, labor markets were typically characterized as weak or mixed, but with occasional pockets of improvement. 
Districts generally reported little or no increase to either price or wage pressures, but references to downward pressures were occasionally noted. While upward price pressures were generally subdued in most Districts, materials prices increased in Cleveland (mainly for steel) and Kansas City. Manufactured goods prices were flat to up slightly in Boston. Boston reported that in some market segments ―product competition and customer clout are leading to downward pressure on prices.‖ Minimal wage pressures were noted in Cleveland and Minneapolis.

ii 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending remained weak in most Districts since the last report, although some improvements were noted. Chicago reported a continued decrease but at a slower rate than in the previous reporting period, and retailers maintained low inventories. Richmond reported flat or declining sales; Dallas indicated sales were largely unchanged. However, Dallas reported unexpected weakness at value-based retailers. Sales were mixed, according to Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City, with Kansas City citing strong sales of cold weather apparel and lower-priced goods. San Francisco remarked that sales were little changed, with the exception of an increase in furniture sales. Although New York observed weak sales in upstate New York, general merchandise retailers in the City were ahead of plan and same-store sales were roughly on par with a year earlier. Boston noted that large-scale retailers had cut inventory due to weak sales. Philadelphia saw a pickup in back-to-school shopping. Cleveland observed that consumers were very price-sensitive and inventories were lean; nonetheless, sales were flat or slightly improved. 
The ―cash-for-clunkers‖ program ended in August, leaving depleted inventories and slower sales in its wake. New vehicle sales declined in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, Chicago reported a pick-up in vehicle sales in early October. Low new-car inventories helped to move used cars in several Districts, although San Francisco commented that the demand for used cars also weakened. New York also reported that automobile dealers saw some improvement in credit conditions for consumers looking to purchase cars. 
Looking to expectations for holiday sales, Chicago anticipated improved sales, while Philadelphia retailers expected consumers to limit spending. However, Third District merchants also noted that store traffic increased recently. Atlanta reported that two-thirds of contacts expected flat or declining sales over the next three months. 
Tourist activity varied across Districts. Boston, New York, and Atlanta described business travel as extremely soft, whereas Richmond observed solid growth in group bookings. Occupancy rates held steady in New York, spurred by increased leisure visitors, while aggressive discounting boosted cruise- line occupancy rates in Atlanta. San Francisco reported a deep slide in hotel and resort visits in Southern California and Las Vegas, but noted a continued firming of occupancy rates in Hawaii. Richmond indicated overall bookings were much improved over last year, while Kansas City reported occupancy rates remained below year-ago-levels. Room rates continued to decline in several Districts, including New York and Atlanta. In contrast, Boston said that hotels were offering dramatic promotional deals and discounts on local attractions, which preserved posted room rates. 
iii 
Nonfinancial Services 
Nonfinancial services firms had mixed reports in recent weeks. Kansas City observed increased demand for high-tech services and Richmond noted generally increased revenues, particularly in telecommunications and healthcare services. Demand for healthcare services also picked up in the Boston District. Minneapolis observed that activity in nonfinancial services firms was mostly flat at low levels, although technology consultants reported an uptick and competition heated up among engineering firms. In contrast, San Francisco contacts indicated that demand for services in general fell, and elective medical procedures were being deferred. St. Louis noted that revenues declined at several large firms in business support services. 
Transportation services activity generally declined, although Cleveland and Chicago reported some strengthening. Atlanta observed weak transportation demand overall, and firms in the San Francisco District indicated that trucking had declined. Import demand in the Dallas District fell, leading to a reduction in cargo volumes at intermodal firms. Activity in the transportation sector was flat, according to Kansas City. In contrast, the cash-for-clunkers program helped to clear dealership lots, which prompted dealers to restock their depleted inventories and drove up car shipments. Chicago reported that trucking shipments increased, although the level of activity remained low, and Cleveland’s contacts cited an uptick in freight transport volume in recent weeks. Cleveland also noted that trucking companies planned substantial equipment purchases through the first quarter of 2010. Business travel by air declined since the last report, according to San Francisco, while airlines in the Dallas District reported stabilized demand—albeit at low levels. Manufacturing 
Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity was generally stronger since the last report. New York, Richmond, Minneapolis and Kansas City all noted a further pickup in production, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago and San Francisco mentioned slight-to-moderate increases. Growth rates varied by industry, however, and some Districts experienced little or no overall increase. Boston reported that manufacturing activity was mixed, but had stabilized or shown modest improvement in certain industries. Similarly, Dallas said overall demand in manufacturing was flat at weak levels albeit with pickups in the high-tech, food, and petrochemical industries. St. Louis indicated that manufacturing continued its net decline, and Atlanta noted moderate declines in orders and production. Some Districts (Boston, Richmond and Chicago) mentioned that year-over-year drops in new orders of housing-related products had abated. Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago reported substantial increases in auto and parts production, which were attributed primarily to restocking dealers’ and manufacturers’ inventories. Accordingly, lean inventories and stronger demand from the auto sector led to an increase in steel production in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. 
iv 
Comments on the near-term outlook varied across Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported that their contacts expected only slight gains and modest economic growth during the next six months. Therefore, capital spending plans remained subdued, and centered mostly on new product development or cost reduction. Dallas indicated that planned projects and routine maintenance were being deferred to conserve capital. New York, however, reported that respondents were increasingly optimistic about the near-term outlook and expected to hire more workers and spend more on capital. Real Estate and Construction. 
Most Districts reported that housing market conditions improved in recent weeks, primarily from a pickup in sales of low- to middle-priced houses. Contacts reported that sales were boosted by the government’s tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Resale activity also edged up in parts of the New York District, although prices continued to be depressed due to a substantial volume of foreclosures and short sales. New and existing home sales remained flat in the Philadelphia District, and home sales continued to decline throughout the St. Louis District. Sales of higher-priced homes were very slow, according to Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City. Moreover, real estate agents in the Boston and Cleveland Districts were uncertain about the future of home sales once the tax credit expires. Availability of financing continued to be a concern for potential buyers in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. 
Residential construction activity remained weak in most Districts. Atlanta reported that construction remained very low, and Cleveland expected new home construction to proceed at a slow pace. Chicago indicated that construction on existing developments edged up, but St. Louis reported that construction activity declined. Kansas City reported that housing starts stabilized, although levels remained well below a year ago and were not expected to improve over the next three months. Philadelphia noted that builders continued to offer increased incentives to boost sales. 
Commercial real estate continued to weaken across the 12 Districts, although even this sector had scattered bright spots. Each District indicated that demand for private commercial real estate was weak, with New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all characterizing activity as declining further since the last report. An inability to obtain credit was often cited as a problem for businesses that wanted to purchase or build space. High vacancy rates were noted as a key concern especially for landlords who were not offering concessions. And, while industrial real estate in the Richmond District was generally weak, renewed interest by retailers to revisit postponed expansion plans was also noted. Finally, public nonresidential construction activity funded by federal stimulus projects was a source of strength in the Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, but gains were often offset by state and local government cutbacks. 
v 
Banking and Financial Services 
Many Districts continued to report weak or declining loan demand, and many noted further erosion of credit quality. For example, demand was reported as stable or declining by New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Cleveland noted that commercial and industrial lending was soft and consumer lending was flat or reduced. In the Richmond District, modest signs of improvement in consumer loans were cited from banks in areas typically supported by the health care and education industries. Philadelphia also reported a small gain in consumer lending. San Francisco said that loan demand was ―largely stable or perhaps rose slightly.‖ A major exception to the general pattern of weak or declining lending activity was in residential real estate. Most Districts cited the federal government’s first-time homebuyer program as supporting residential lending activity. However, Dallas reported that residential mortgage demand was disappointing, and St. Louis mentioned a moderate decline in real estate lending. 
Credit quality continued to be a problem, and rising delinquencies were often noted. For example, credit quality was described as stable or declining in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts. Half of the contacts for Kansas City expected loan quality to continue to erode over the next six months. Cleveland stated that the quality of loan applicants had deteriorated somewhat, mostly on the business side. Delinquencies were also widely reported to be up; New York particularly noted rising delinquency rates among both consumer and commercial mortgage loans. Employment, Wages, and Prices. 
Labor market conditions were generally reported as weak or mixed across Districts, but a few encouraging signs were noted. Employment activity was soft in the Kansas City District, and hiring remained limited in the Boston District. While a slowdown in layoffs was reported by Atlanta, no hiring was generally expected. Reports from Cleveland were mixed, but indicated declining employment in commercial construction and coal mining. Employment levels held steady in the Dallas District, with scattered reports of layoffs. However, staffing firms there noted improvement in contract and temporary employment. Minneapolis reported a weak labor market, but some signs of improvement were noted among auto-related industries. A major New York employment agency specializing in office workers reported renewed softening in recent weeks, with only scattered hiring at financial institutions and virtually no hiring in the legal and publishing industries. Richmond noted reports from temporary employment agencies were evenly mixed between reports of strengthening and weakening, but with increased optimism for the near term expressed since the last report. 
Wage and price pressures were generally described as subdued across most Districts. Wages were flat in the San Francisco District, but increased moderately in the Minneapolis District. In the Boston District, business services firms (mainly advertising and consulting) reported modest salary increases, but 
vi 
a decline in bonuses left total compensation slightly reduced. Wage pressures were characterized as ―not significant‖ in the Chicago District and ―contained‖ in the Cleveland District. 
Prices followed a similar pattern to wages, with reports of little significant pressure on either input or output prices, although moderate increases were observed for materials prices. For example, prices movements were characterized as generally subdued or little changed in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. Cleveland noted stable construction materials prices, but added that the cost of steel had experienced an uptick. Materials prices in general were reported to be up in the Kansas City District. Boston said that selling prices of manufacturing goods were flat to slightly up, but noted that product competition and consumer clout was leading to downward pressures in some market segments. Retail price inflation slowed slightly in the Richmond District, while retail prices were stable in the Philadelphia District and edged down in the Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Agriculture and Natural Resources. 
Assessments of agricultural activity were mixed. Reports from Richmond and Minneapolis indicated that favorable growing conditions allowed farmers to make steady progress in harvesting summer crops and planting winter crops. In some parts of the Minneapolis District, however, a persistent drought delayed harvesting. In contrast, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts all noted unusually high amounts of rainfall. In the Atlanta District, floods damaged some of North Georgia’s nurseries, vegetable farms, and commercial vineyards, but benefited Florida citrus growers. Similarly, widespread rains brought much-needed relief to drought-stricken parts of the Dallas District, allowing many ranchers to scale back costly supplemental feeding—but not in time to prevent severe losses to livestock and crops. Chicago and St. Louis mentioned that wet weather had slowed crop maturity and harvesting, while Chicago reported lower than expected yields. Kansas City indicated that, despite some delayed harvests, farmers expected above-average yields. 
Activity in the energy industry remained weak. Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported increases in oil and gas inventories as demand continued to weaken. Atlanta indicated that refining margins continued to deteriorate, which led to delays in new projects. Cleveland noted that sharply lower contract prices for coal prompted coal miners to continue their deep cutbacks in production and to keep their capital spending on hold. Kansas City mentioned that overall drilling activity improved slightly, but that rig counts were still at historically low levels. Dallas remarked that rig counts rose in September and early October, spurred by oil drilling. However, Dallas also indicated that, despite the increase, excess capacity in the industry had resulted in job losses and weak domestic pricing. Minneapolis reported that activity in the energy and mining sectors increased slightly and noted that oil and gas exploration inched up in late September.",0,1
2009-10-31,"Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity 
continued to stabilize in July and August. Relative to the last report, Dallas indicated that economic activity had firmed, while Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco mentioned signs of improvement. Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and New York generally described economic activity as stable or showing signs of stabilization; St. Louis remarked that the pace of decline appeared to be moderating. Most Districts noted that the outlook for economic activity among their business contacts remained cautiously positive. 
The majority of Districts reported flat retail sales. Richmond, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Boston remarked that retailers continued to carefully manage inventories, keeping them in line with low sales levels. A majority of Districts confirmed that the “cash-for-clunkers” program boosted traffic and sales. Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis also noted increases or planned increases in automobile- related production. Most regions reported some improvement in residential real estate markets. Downward pressure on home prices continued in most Districts, although Dallas and New York noted that local prices were firming. Reports on commercial real estate suggest that the demand for space remained weak and that nonresidential construction-related activity continued to decline. San Francisco, Philadelphia, and St. Louis noted that the demand for nonfinancial services remained soft, although the pace of the decline was described as slowing in the latter two Districts. Loan demand was described as weak and many Districts reported that credit standards remained tight. Most Districts reported improvements in manufacturing production. For instance, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Cleveland, and Chicago reported moderate increases in new orders. Labor market conditions remained weak across all Districts. However, staffing firms in Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, and Chicago did report a slight pickup in the demand for temporary workers.

i 
Wage pressures remained minimal across all Districts. Consumer prices were described as being steady in most Districts, although Kansas City and San Francisco noted some downward pressure on retail prices. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending remained soft in most Districts. The majority of Districts reported that retail activity was flat. Boston, Philadelphia, and Kansas City noted improvement in sales, but attributed the increase primarily to back-to-school purchases. Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, and San Francisco observed that shoppers remained focused on essentials and continued to refrain from purchasing discretionary and big- ticket items. Kansas City and San Francisco noted weak restaurant sales. Richmond, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Boston remarked that retailer inventories were being closely monitored and were keeping them in line with low sales levels. 
The majority of Districts reported that the cash-for-clunkers program helped boost traffic and sales, although Cleveland and Kansas City also remarked that used car sales were adversely affected by the program. The sustainability of the higher recent pace of new vehicle sales was questioned by industry contacts in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. 
Tourism activity varied. Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Richmond observed solid visitor numbers at local vacation destinations, whereas Atlanta and New York noted sluggish activity and aggressive hotel discounting. San Francisco reported that activity in California and Nevada was weak, but visitors to Hawaii had increased. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate markets remained weak, but signs of improvement continued to be noted. Chicago, Richmond, Boston, and San Francisco observed an uptick in sales over the last six weeks, while sales in the Philadelphia District were described as steady. St. Louis commented that residential home sales had not improved. Most Districts reported that sales remained below the levels of a year earlier. However, Atlanta, New York, Cleveland, and Minneapolis documented some year-over-year gains 
ii 
in select markets. Most Districts noted that demand remained stronger at the low-end of the housing market. Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Richmond, and New York indicated that the first-time home buyer tax incentive was spurring sales. However, Philadelphia did note an upturn in sales at the high-end of the market. Reports on house prices generally indicated ongoing downward pressures, although Dallas and New York noted some increases. Construction remained at low levels overall, although Chicago and Dallas reported a small increase in activity. 
Reports on commercial real estate markets indicated that demand for space remained weak and that construction continued to decline in all Districts. Atlanta, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco reported that vacancy rates increased, while rates held steady in the Boston and Kansas City Districts and were mixed in New York. Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Richmond commented that the demand for space remained weak. Commercial rents declined according to Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond. Rent concessions were reported in the Richmond and San Francisco markets, and Richmond noted that some landlords had postponed property improvements in an effort to conserve cash. Construction remained at very low levels, with modest improvements noted in public construction in the Chicago, Cleveland, and Minneapolis Districts. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Reports on the demand for nonfinancial services were mixed. San Francisco, Philadelphia, and St. Louis noted that the demand for service sector business remained soft, although the pace of decline was described as having slowed in the latter two Districts. The demand for legal services remained relatively flat at low levels according to Dallas and Minneapolis. Kansas City and Richmond cited increasing demand for technology-related services. Healthcare services in Minneapolis also experienced an uptick in demand. Demand for transportation services were mixed, with some Districts noting stabilization at weak levels. Reports indicated that freight volume declines were moderating in Cleveland, while Dallas and Atlanta reported a modest pickup in rail shipments. 
iii 
Banking and Financial Services 
Most Districts reported that loan demand was weak and that credit standards remained tight. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, St. Louis, and San Francisco observed further weakening in loan demand across most categories. Dallas noted scattered reports of improvements in loan demand. Contacts in Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas noted an increase in demand for auto loans. Credit standards ranged from unchanged to tighter in most Districts. However, Chicago reported that credit conditions and availability had improved. 
Mortgage activity declined modestly according to the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts, while Richmond reported increases attributed to improved demand for starter homes. Dallas noted an uptick in refinancing activity. Commercial and industrial lending declined in the Philadelphia and Kansas City regions, and was steady according to Richmond. The lack of available credit was cited as an issue for both residential and commercial contractors in Cleveland, and for commercial real estate borrowers in Atlanta. San Francisco reported an increase in venture capital investment. 
Further deterioration in credit quality was noted by Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco, whereas Cleveland observed some improvement in credit quality. Chicago also cited improvements in credit quality, apart from home equity and commercial real estate. Dallas and Chicago noted increases in consumer bankruptcies, while rising delinquency rates were reported by New York and Cleveland. 
Manufacturing 
Most Districts reported modest improvements in the manufacturing sector. Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Cleveland, and Chicago all reported slight-to-moderate increases in new orders. San Francisco indicated that new orders increased for manufacturers of semiconductors and other IT products, while orders declined for metal fabricators and petroleum refineries. Dallas noted that orders held steady, while St. Louis reported that manufacturing output continued to decline, but at a slower pace. Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported increases or planned increases in automobile 
iv 
and automobile-related production. Several Districts also noted increased production in the pharmaceutical industry. 
The near-term outlook among manufacturers varied, but the majority of reports indicated that manufacturers were cautiously optimistic. Boston, New York, and Philadelphia reported that their contacts expect modest growth later this year or early 2010. Boston noted that while its contacts generally expect modest growth, several cost control measures would remain in place. Dallas reported increased uncertainty among construction-related manufacturers, while Cleveland noted that half of their manufacturing contacts expected weak demand into 2010. 
Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Labor market conditions remained weak across all Districts, but several also noted an uptick in temporary hiring and a decline in the pace of layoffs. Richmond reported that most service-providing firms continued to cut employees, while Minneapolis and New York noted additional layoffs in the manufacturing sector. Cleveland reported modest job declines in the banking, commercial construction, and coal mining sectors. Further job cuts are expected in auto manufacturing according to St. Louis, and Dallas indicated further staff reductions are anticipated in the airline, energy, and residential construction sectors. Staffing firms in a majority of Districts reported a modest increase in the demand for temporary workers, although industry contacts in Boston also questioned whether these gains will persist. New York cited a modest pickup in temporary hiring for the legal and financial industries. Chicago noted an uptick in demand for workers in the healthcare and information technology industries. St. Louis and Minneapolis reported that federal stimulus funds have had a positive impact on construction and local government jobs. 
Wage pressures remained low across all Districts. Several Districts noted businesses and local governments imposing wage freezes or even reducing employee compensation in some instances. Boston noted that several manufacturers who have cut wage rates do not expect to restore pay levels until next year. Kansas City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, and Richmond noted an increase in the cost of some raw materials, including fuel, metals, and steel. Chicago and Dallas mentioned 
v 
that excess supply was putting substantial downward pressure on natural gas prices. Retail prices were described as generally steady in most Districts, although Kansas City and San Francisco noted continued discounting and downward pressure on consumer prices. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Reports on agricultural activity were mixed. Weather conditions were described as being favorable in St. Louis, Kansas City, and Atlanta. However, cold weather, crop diseases, and drought were limiting production of corn, cotton, and soybeans in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. Drought and weak market conditions were significantly affecting livestock industries according to Kansas City and Dallas. Dallas reported that some ranchers had liquidated portions of their cattle herds, while hog producers in the Kansas City District were said to be struggling as a result of lower pork prices. 
Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted increased oil and gas inventories as a result of reduced consumption. Contacts in the natural gas industry noted that subdued demand continued to suppress prices and has lead to cutbacks in extraction activity. Cleveland indicated that weak demand for electricity prompted coal producers to scale back production and capital investment. Kansas City noted that although coal production in Wyoming had risen, it remained below year-ago levels. Dallas and Atlanta remarked that oil and gas drilling activity continued to decline in the Gulf of Mexico, whereas Kansas City and Dallas reported that the number of rigs operating on land had increased.",1,0
2009-08-31,"Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity continued to be 
weak going into the summer, but most Districts indicated that the pace of decline has moderated since the last report or that activity has begun to stabilize, albeit at a low level. Five Districts used the words “slow”, “subdued”, or “weak” to describe activity levels; Chicago and St. Louis reported that the pace of decline appeared to be moderating; and New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco pointed to signs of stabilization. Minneapolis said the District economy had contracted since the last report. 
Most Districts reported sluggish retail activity. Cleveland, Richmond, and Minneapolis noted further declines in sales, although results were somewhat mixed or positive according to retailers in the Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Manufacturing activity showed some improvement in the Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts; while St. Louis and Dallas reported some moderation of declines; Philadelphia and Minneapolis saw activity decrease; and most other Districts indicated that manufacturing activity continued at low levels. Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported contractions in services industries. Banking sectors in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts experienced weaker demand for some categories of loans. Residential real estate markets stayed soft in most Districts, although many noted some signs of improvement. By contrast, commercial real estate markets weakened further in recent months in two-thirds of the Districts and remained slow in the others. 
Districts reported varied—but generally modest—price changes across sectors and products, with competitive pressures damping increases; however, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted that some metals prices have increased in recent months. Most Districts indicated that labor markets were extremely soft, with minimal wage pressures, and cited the use of various methods of reducing compensation in addition to, or instead of, freezing or cutting wages.

i 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending in the early summer remained below previous-year levels in most Districts, as households continued to be price conscious. Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco experienced either modest sales increases or less negative sales results than in recent reporting periods. Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, New York, and Dallas cited flat or mixed sales, while sales in the remaining Districts remained soft. Several Districts noted that consumers focused on purchasing less expensive necessities, while sales of big ticket items languished. Retailers in Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas characterized their outlook as cautious. 
Auto sales were mixed across the country. Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City saw modest increases in car sales, while New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta continued to experience subdued sales. The exception was sales of used vehicles, which continued to be strong or were strengthening, according to Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco. 
Travel and tourism declined in the majority of Districts. The San Francisco District observed a sharp drop in luxury and business travel, while tourism activity in New York City was weak but stable since the last Beige Book report. Tourism contacts along the Atlantic coast reported that with the exception of July 4th holiday bookings, business was generally weaker than a year ago. Hotel room rates have declined in several Districts. 
Nonfinancial Services 
District reports regarding nonfinancial services industries were largely negative, although they included a few bright spots. The Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts indicated that demand for professional services such as business support, architecture, and legal services continued to decline or remained soft. By contrast, reports from the healthcare sector were largely positive, with the San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Richmond Districts citing steady to increased demand for medical services, and the Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reporting hiring activity in health care. Technology-related firms in the Kansas City District also reported heightened activity, especially in the 
ii 
clean technology and defense-driven aerospace markets. Richmond and Minneapolis noted increased demand for information technology workers, and Atlanta saw hiring activity in the defense and aerospace industry. Staffing industry contacts in numerous Districts suggested a higher demand for temporary or part-time workers over permanent hires, and Atlanta noted that employers were taking advantage of a higher supply of skilled labor to improve the quality of their workforces. 
Nearly all Districts reporting on transportation services observed continued weakness. Freight transport respondents from the Atlanta, Dallas, and Cleveland Districts noted that cargo volumes remain below year-earlier levels. While Cleveland contacts reported that competitive shipping rates are being maintained, trucking contacts from the Atlanta District noted that an oversupply of trucks relative to demand has exerted downward pressure on rates. A few Districts also reported reduced airline traffic, especially amongst business travelers. 
Manufacturing 
Reports on the manufacturing sector remained subdued but were slightly more positive than in the previous Beige Book. Many Districts characterized manufacturing activity as remaining depressed but with selected signs of modest improvement. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Atlanta, and St. Louis reported decreased manufacturing activity; however, the latter two Districts noted that the overall rate of decline abated in the latest reporting period. Richmond and Kansas City reported rising manufacturing activity, albeit chiefly in nondurables industries. Districts attributed some of the recent increases in production to replenishment of finished-goods or customer inventories. 
Chicago indicated that the quick resolutions of the Chrysler and GM bankruptcies have boosted business confidence, and that automakers were scheduling a pickup in production for July. However, ongoing shutdowns of domestic auto plants have led to precariously low business volumes for parts suppliers, according to Chicago and St. Louis. Steel production remained depressed but has leveled off or increased somewhat, according to Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis. Similarly, Dallas observed that refineries increased their capacity utilization slightly over the past six weeks, but that overall industry 
iii 
conditions remain weak because of low demand for fuels. Various District reports noted cancellations of orders for commercial aircraft and continued weak demand for most types of equipment and machinery. Among the positive developments in manufacturing, several Districts mentioned pickups in technology sectors, or cited strong or rising sales of military products or pharmaceuticals. 
Comments on the near-term outlook varied across Districts, but on the whole they appear consistent with a forecast of modest and uneven recovery in manufacturing output beginning during roughly the coming six to twelve months. New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta indicated that manufacturers have a generally positive or improved near-term outlook. Dallas reported that high-tech manufacturers “are seeing some upside potential in their forecasts instead of just down-side risks,” but that construction-related manufacturers “expect no improvement in the near term.” Boston indicated that many respondents expect continued sub-par revenue numbers for the remainder of the year, but “look forward to slowly improving business in 2010,” while Cleveland and Kansas City reported that manufacturing contacts expect little or no change in demand through the end of 2009. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Commercial real estate leasing markets were described as either “weak” or “slow” in all 12 Districts, although the severity of the downturn varied somewhat across Districts. While the office vacancy rate was up and rents were down in the Dallas District, market fundamentals there remained stronger than the national average. Market conditions in the New York District are significantly worse than one year ago, on average, but have been relatively stable in recent weeks and some parts of the District report improving fundamentals. Office vacancy rates continued to climb in the Atlanta, Boston, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, as well as in Manhattan, resulting in sizable leasing concessions and/or declines in asking rents. Significant weakness in the retail leasing sector was reported for the Boston, Minneapolis, and New York Districts, and industrial vacancy increased in the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts. Commercial real estate sales volume remained low, even “non-existent” in some Districts, reportedly due to a combination of tight 
iv 
credit and weak demand. Construction activity was limited and/or declining in most Districts, although exceptions were noted for health and institutional construction in the St. Louis District, public sector construction in the Chicago District, and the reconstruction of the World Trade Center in Manhattan. Tight credit was cited as an ongoing factor in the dearth of new construction activity. The commercial real estate outlook was mixed, both within and across Districts. Some contacts expect commercial real estate markets to improve within two quarters and others predict further market deterioration for the remainder of 2009 and possibly through late 2010. 
Residential real estate markets in most Districts remained weak, but many reported signs of improvement. The Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts cited large increases in home sales compared with 2008 levels, and other Districts reported rising sales in some submarkets. Of the areas that continued to experience year-over-year sales declines, all except St Louis—where sales were down steeply— also reported that the pace of decline was moderating. In general, the low end of the market, especially entry- level homes, continued to perform relatively well; contacts in the New York, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts attributed this relative strength, at least in part, to the first-time homebuyer tax credit. Condo sales were still far below year-before levels according to the Boston and New York reports. In general, home prices continued to decline in most markets, although a number of Districts saw possible signs of stabilization. The Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts mentioned that the increasing number of foreclosure sales was exerting downward pressure on home prices. Residential construction reportedly remains quite slow, with the Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts noting that financing is difficult. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
The farm sector reported better weather in much of the country in June and early July. As a result, the supply and condition of many crops have improved, and prices have fallen. In the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, generally favorable weather has facilitated the vegetable, small grain or fruit harvest-- much of which is in good condition. Similarly, contacts in several Districts including Chicago, 
v 
St. Louis, and Kansas City indicated that the size and condition of the corn, soybean and/or rice crops have improved and that farmers are now planning to harvest more acres than previously expected; thus, prices and profits are−and for the short term are expected to remain−down. By contrast, the production of wheat or barley is expected to fall well below strong 2008 levels in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts. In the Dallas District, where a drought continues, much of the corn, cotton, and other crops were described as “not worth harvesting,” and producers are collecting insurance. 
Livestock contacts in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts report that prices for dairy, hogs, and cattle have fallen by more than operating costs and some ranchers are liquidating herds. In the Chicago District, livestock operations have reportedly lost their cash cushion and have been unable to get financing; contacts in Dallas, where the ongoing drought has destroyed forage, also note concerns about ranchers’ cash flow. 
With oil prices up to $70 per barrel in the first half of 2009 but recently trending down, oil production was reportedly flat in June and early July in the Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts and up slightly in Dallas and San Francisco. Contacts in Atlanta indicate that the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico had fallen by half year over year while in Dallas the number of working rigs was up slightly. Natural gas prices continue to fall, discouraging drilling in the Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Kansas City energy producers report financial strains and are cutting headcounts selectively, while contacts in Dallas observe much excess capacity and weak demand for energy services. In response to weak demand from the utilities, coal prices in the Cleveland District have fallen 50 percent since early 2009, and coal production, jobs and hours are down; capital spending has fallen to minimum maintenance levels. In Minneapolis, by contrast, new wind projects have been announced. Banking and Financial Services 
In most reporting Districts, overall lending activity was stable or weakened further for most loan categories. In contrast, Philadelphia reported a slight increase in business, consumer, and residential real estate lending. As businesses remained pessimistic and reluctant to borrow, demand for commercial and 
vi 
industrial loans continued to fall or stay weak in the New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Consumer loan demand decreased in New York, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, stabilized at a low level in Chicago and Dallas, and was steady to up in Cleveland. 
Residential real estate lending decreased in New York, Richmond, and St. Louis. Dallas reported steady but low outstanding mortgage volumes, while Kansas City noted that the rise in mortgage loans slowed. Refinancing activity fell dramatically in Richmond, decreased in New York and Cleveland, and maintained its pace in Dallas. Bankers in the New York District indicated no change in delinquency rates in all loan categories except residential mortgages, while Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported rising delinquencies on loans linked to real estate. 
Banks continued to tighten credit standards in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts; and some have stepped up the requirements for the commercial real estate category, in particular, due to concern over declining loan quality. Meanwhile, Cleveland and Atlanta reported that higher credit standards remained in place, with no change expected in the near term. Credit quality deteriorated in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco, while loan quality exceeded expectations in Chicago and remained steady in Richmond. Employment, Wages, and Prices 
All Districts indicated that labor markets remain slack, with most sectors either reducing jobs or holding them steady and aggregate employment continuing to decline, on net. However, Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis noted selective hiring, including attempts by some firms to take advantage of layoffs elsewhere to pick up experienced talent. Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas cited moderation in the pace of manufacturing employment decline since the last report, and New York noted some signs of labor market stabilization. But Atlanta reported further deterioration in labor market conditions and additional job cuts already planned for coming months. 
The weakness of labor markets has virtually eliminated upward wage pressure, and wages and compensation are steady or falling in most Districts; however, Boston cited some manufacturing and 
vii 
business services firms raising pay selectively, and Minneapolis said wage increases were moderate. Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco cited a range of methods firms are using to limit compensation, including cutting or freezing wages or benefit contributions, deferral of future salary increases, trimming bonuses and travel allowances, reducing hours, temporary shutdowns, periodic furloughs, and unpaid vacations. 
Most Districts reported that upward price pressures were minimal. Manufacturers in the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts indicated that most materials costs were flat or down; however, several Districts mentioned price increases for some metals, petrochemicals, and building materials. While the Boston, New York, and Kansas City reports say a few firms are making modest price increases stick, selling prices of most manufacturers and retailers were reportedly held down by competitive pressures. Services firms have increased discounting and/or cut fees, according to contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco, while Richmond indicated price increases for services were mild.",0,1
2009-07-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve District Banks indicate that economic conditions remained weak or deteriorated further during the period from mid-April through May. However, five of the Districts noted that the downward trend is showing signs of moderating. Further, contacts from several Districts said that their expectations have improved, though they do not see a substantial increase in economic activity through the end of the year. 
Manufacturing activity declined or remained at a low level across most Districts. However, several Districts also reported that the outlook by manufacturers has improved somewhat. Demand for nonfinancial services contracted across Districts reporting on this segment. Retail spending remained soft as consumers focused on purchasing less expensive necessities and shied away from buying luxury goods. New car purchases remained depressed, with several Districts indicating that tight credit conditions were hampering auto sales. Travel and tourism activity also declined. A number of Districts reported an uptick in home sales, and many said that new home construction appeared to have stabilized at very low levels. Vacancy rates for commercial properties were rising in many parts of the country, while developers are finding financing for new commercial projects increasingly difficult to obtain. Most Districts reported that overall lending activity was stable or weak, but with mixed results across loan categories. Credit conditions remained stringent or tightened further. Energy activity continued to weaken across most Districts, and demand for natural resources remained depressed. Planting and growing conditions varied across Districts as did agricultural input costs. 
Labor market conditions continued to be weak across the country, with wages generally remaining flat or falling. Two Districts also mentioned employers’ plans to scale back employee benefit programs. The Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts reported that some state and local governments

ii faced hiring freezes or outright job cuts. While manufacturing employment levels remained low, some 
Districts saw signs that job losses may be moderating. With few exceptions, Districts reported that prices at all stages of production were generally flat or falling. The notable exception to the downward pressure on prices was the widely-reported increase in oil prices. 
Manufacturing. Manufacturing declined or remained weak in most Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported declines in activity, while production remained at very low levels in the San Francisco District. Atlanta and Kansas City indicated that the pace of the decline in manufacturing had moderated or slowed. New York characterized the sector as having stabilized, while Dallas mentioned signs of stabilization. In contrast, Richmond reported a rise in both new orders and shipments. 
Philadelphia reported that the primary metals, machinery, and electrical equipment industries remain especially weak, and Cleveland noted that steel shipments continue at depressed levels. Chicago commented that, apart from Asia, export demand was weak. Dallas reported that construction-related manufacturing and the petrochemicals markets remained weak, while San Francisco stated that activity in the wood products industry was depressed and that demand in the metal fabrication industry was extremely weak. Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas all noted weakness in automotive-related industries. In contrast, Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that high technology industries experienced some increase in activity, and Richmond noted strengthening across a number of industries. Several Districts also reported that the outlook of manufacturers has improved somewhat, though Boston, Cleveland and Kansas City mentioned that capital spending was weak. 
Nonfinancial Services. Districts reporting on nonfinancial services indicated that for the most part activity continued to decline. Looking at some specific sectors, providers of health-care services spoke of job cuts and lower patient volumes. Activity continued to weaken or remain soft for providers of professional services such as accounting, architecture, business consulting, and legal services. In contrast, San Francisco reported a substantial pickup in real estate services such as title insurance due to 
iii an increase in home refinancing. Activity in IT services varied, with New England firms experiencing 
declining revenue and business, while demand for IT workers in Richmond and Chicago was reportedly on the rise. High-tech service sales in Kansas City increased moderately, and demand there is expected to strengthen. 
Transportation contacts in most Districts say that shipping volume either remained at low levels or continued to decline. Contacts in the Cleveland District generally stated that while shipping volumes remain down across all market segments, the steep drop-off earlier this year has abated. Cargo and container trade in Richmond and Dallas remains at low levels, but contacts noted signs of improvement in import and export activity. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism. Consumer spending remained soft as households focused on purchasing less expensive necessities. Reports from New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated a modest rise in sales, while retail purchases in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco were flat or mixed. The other Districts experienced declining sales. Several Districts reported that discounters have seen their sales increase, while purchases of luxury goods continued to weaken. Respondents from Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas expect soft consumer sales to persist. Purchases of new cars remained depressed across most Districts. However, Chicago saw a small increase in auto sales, which respondents attributed to incentives and promotions. New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City indicated that tight credit conditions hampered auto sales. Reports from Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicate that sales of used vehicles are rising. 
Travel and tourism activity declined, and vacationers are tending to spend less. Business at Manhattan hotels and Broadway theaters, which had increased modestly in April, fell back in May. Bookings at resorts in the Richmond District are starting to pick up; however, they are weaker than a year ago. In the Atlanta District, promotions and discounting were said to have played a significant role in 
iv keeping theme park attendance and cruise bookings stable. Contacts from the San Francisco District said 
that pronounced declines in hotel occupancy rates, especially luxury hotels, were ongoing, while travel in some parts of the District remained down at double-digit rates from the previous year. However, a report from the Minneapolis District indicated that summer reservations at campgrounds and resorts are strong. 
Real Estate and Construction. Although the residential real estate market remains weak, agents in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported an uptick in home sales. The reasons cited include seasonal factors, low interest rates, declining house prices, and tax credits for first-time buyers. Much of the sales increase was found in the lower-priced end of the market. New home construction appeared to have stabilized at very low levels in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco, although Kansas City reported an uptick in construction. Home inventories were trending down in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, Chicago reported that inventories remain elevated. 
Commercial real estate markets continued to weaken across all Districts. Vacancy rates for commercial properties were rising in many regions of the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts putting downward pressure on rents. Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported new construction projects being postponed or cancelled, and new construction in the New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis Districts dropped substantially. Eight Districts cited difficulty in obtaining financing as one of the primary reasons for delaying or stopping construction of new developments and for limiting sales of existing properties. 
Banking and Finance. Most Districts reported that overall lending activity was stable or weak, but with mixed results across loan categories. Demand for commercial and industrial loans fell in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas singled out commercial real estate as experiencing weakening demand. Boston reported that commercial real estate transactions were increasingly scarce, and Dallas noted that loan renewals in this category required more borrower equity and smaller loan sizes than in the past. Atlanta and Chicago reported 
v limited credit availability for vehicle dealers and other businesses tied to the auto industry. Demand for 
mortgage refinancing loans was mixed. New York and Cleveland reported strong demand for these loans, while Richmond noted a waning of residential refinancing demand due to rising interest rates. Richmond also reported an uptick in demand for purchase mortgage loans. 
Most Districts said that credit conditions remained stringent or tightened further. Reports from Philadelphia and Cleveland expected that credit will remain tight in the near term. The credit quality of loan applicants and existing clients showed deterioration in Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, and Dallas, although Richmond noted that the rate of deterioration has slowed. New York and Cleveland said that delinquencies had increased across numerous loan categories, particularly those tied to real estate. Cleveland and Kansas City reported increases in bank deposits, with the latter attributing the rise to uncertainty about financial markets. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Planting and growing conditions varied across Districts, with favorable developments in Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, a drought hindered Oklahoma’s wheat crop and livestock production in Southwest Texas. Above-normal rainfall delayed planting of major crops in the Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Storms in the Minneapolis District destroyed fields and led to higher-than-normal deaths in calving. The Chicago and Kansas City Districts both said that lower cattle and hog prices along with higher feed costs have worsened the income prospect for livestock producers. Input costs in San Francisco, though, have stayed at moderate levels, and sales have continued at a solid pace for most types of agricultural output. 
Energy activity continued to weaken across most Districts, and demand for natural resources remained depressed. Coal production and prices fell substantially in the Cleveland District. The number of drilling rigs operating in the Kansas City District is sixty percent below its peak last fall, and working rigs in Texas have fallen fifteen percent over the past six weeks as global demand for oil remains low. However, one production facility in the Gulf of Mexico just opened in May and is expected to make a 
vi major contribution to oil and natural gas output once it reaches full production. Wind energy projects 
expanded in the Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts. Employment and Wages. Labor market conditions continued to be weak across the country, 
with wages generally remaining flat or falling. Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that businesses were cutting or freezing wages, and Boston cited wage freezes in the retail sector. The Chicago District reported that the downward pressure on wages was abating somewhat there, as firms turned instead to cutting hours or jobs outright to contain labor costs. Firms in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts also reported having to cut hours to reduce costs. In addition, the Boston and San Francisco Districts also mentioned employers’ plans to scale back employee benefit programs. 
In the service sector, the Boston and Cleveland Districts reported relatively stable retail employment, while the Richmond District reported continuing reductions. The Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted that firms providing professional services, such as accounting, consulting, and legal services, continued to report staff reductions, while the Boston and New York Districts reported weak demand for financial services workers, with ongoing layoffs at large financial firms. The Boston and Richmond Districts also reported reductions in information technology jobs. The Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts reported that some state and local governments faced hiring freezes or outright job cuts. 
In manufacturing, while employment levels remained low, several Districts saw signs that job losses may be moderating. The New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts all reported less severe employment reductions in recent weeks, with some optimism that manufacturing employment levels may soon stabilize. This, however, was balanced by reports of ongoing manufacturing employment losses in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. 
Staffing services firms reported some modest signs of recovery, with the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts all reporting some stabilization in activity or a slight improvement in 
vii employment trends. The Cleveland and Richmond Districts, however, continued to report that activity 
among staffing services firms was weak. Prices. With few exceptions, the District Banks reported that prices at all stages of production 
were generally flat or falling. Manufacturers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco said that overall input prices were stable or declining, although in Kansas City those declines were said to be moderating. In contrast, Richmond noted that prices of raw materials had increased at a quicker pace. The notable exception to the downward pressure on input prices was oil. Increases in oil prices were widely reported. However, prices for other energy commodities, like coal and natural gas, remained relatively low. Other exceptions to the prevailing price trend included agricultural items. The Atlanta and Kansas City Districts reported some increases in agricultural prices, with the latter noting that these higher prices were partly driven by global weather concerns. The Chicago and Kansas City Districts also reported higher prices for livestock feed. In construction, the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts reported higher prices for some building supplies, perhaps related to increase in petroleum prices. 
Reports from a number of Districts indicated that pricing at retail remains very soft. The Cleveland and Dallas Districts indicated that retail prices were stable, San Francisco said that they were held down by discounting, and Philadelphia noted that steady input costs were holding retail prices in check. In Kansas City, retail prices were declining and expected to soften further. Richmond’s retail prices continued to rise, albeit more slowly than in the past.",0,1
2009-05-31,"Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicate that overall economic activity contracted further or remained weak. However, five of the twelve Districts noted a moderation in the pace of decline, and several saw signs that activity in some sectors was stabilizing at a low level. 
Manufacturing activity weakened across a broad range of industries in most Districts, with only a few exceptions. Nonfinancial service activity continued to contract across Districts. Retail spending remained sluggish, although some Districts noted a slight improvement in sales compared with the previous reporting period. Residential real estate markets continued to be weak. Home prices and construction were still falling in most areas, but better-than-expected buyer traffic led to a scattered pickup in sales in a number of Districts. Nonresidential real estate conditions continued to deteriorate. Difficulty obtaining commercial real estate financing was constraining construction and investment activity. Spending on business travel declined as corporations cut back. Reports on tourism were mixed. Bankers reported tight credit conditions, rising delinquencies, and some deterioration of loan quality. 
Agricultural conditions were generally favorable across Districts, although drought conditions persisted in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. The Districts reporting on energy said reduced demand, high inventories, and lower prices led to steep cutbacks in oil and natural gas drilling and production activity. The Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted declines in employment in the oil and gas extraction industry. 
Downward pressure on prices was reported across Districts. Wage and salary pressures eased as labor markets weakened in all Districts, and many contacts continued to report job cuts and wage and hiring freezes. Employment continued to decline across a range of industries, with only scattered reports of hiring.

ii 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity continued to decline in most Districts and across a wide range of industries. Several reports, however, noted that the pace of decline had slowed or that factory activity had stabilized. The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts cited decreases in production. The Chicago and Kansas City Districts said declines in production had slowed. The Cleveland District noted some leveling off in declines in new orders, and the New York and Dallas Districts noted that demand was beginning to bottom out following steep declines. Orders and shipments of capital goods, autos, paper, and construction-related equipment and products such as metals, wood products, lumber and electrical machinery remained mostly sluggish and below year-ago levels, with the Chicago District noting an increase in order cancellations and deferral requests. Aircraft makers in the Chicago District noted declines in demand, while aerospace manufacturers in the San Francisco District reported that a drop in airline passenger traffic and cargo capacity had spurred order cancellations and delivery deferrals. 
In contrast, orders and sales of high-tech equipment firmed somewhat at very weak levels in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Defense firms in the Boston and Cleveland Districts reported solid activity. Food manufacturers saw sales gains in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts, and a food manufacturer in the St. Louis District noted plans to open a new plant. Pharmaceutical firms in the Boston and Chicago Districts continued to see solid demand; petrochemical producers in the Dallas District noted a slight turnaround in operating rates. 
Manufacturers’ assessments of future factory activity improved marginally over the survey period as well, with contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noting a slight upturn in the outlook for production and sales. Capital expenditure plans remained on hold across most regions, and the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts noted cuts in capital budgets. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Districts that report on nonfinancial business services said demand continued to fall across most industries. Providers of health-care services noted further declines in activity, and contacts in several Districts noted demand for professional services, such as architecture, business consulting and legal services, remained weak. Demand for IT services was mixed. 
iii 
Among service firms, there were reports of customers delaying payments or asking for price reductions, and receivables were harder to collect. 
While there were scattered reports of optimism, temporary staffing firms generally continued to report weak conditions. Firms in the Dallas District were not renewing contracts on current personnel, and the New York District characterized the supply of available workers as “inexhaustible.” 
Shipping activity continued to fall over the past six weeks as both domestic and international demand remained dampened. Contacts in several Districts said shipments of construction-related manufacturing products continued to drop at a substantial pace. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending remained generally weak. However, several Districts said sales rose slightly or declines moderated compared with the previous survey period. In particular, the Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts reported an improvement in sales. Purchases of big ticket and luxury items continued to decline while spending on food and necessities fared better. The Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that consumers were looking for value, and were opting for lower-priced, private label products over higher-priced alternatives. Retailers kept inventories lean, in line with the slow pace of sales, and most expect demand to stay at current low levels over the next few months. 
Auto dealers continued to struggle, and overall vehicle sales were sluggish in all reporting Districts as weak demand and tight credit continued to limit sales. Used vehicle sales improved slightly in the Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, but new car sales remained feeble. Dealers in the Philadelphia District reported difficulty in obtaining financing for inventory purchases, and a few dealerships in the St. Louis District went out of business, but dealers in the Cleveland District reported minimal problems with floor-plan financing. While auto dealers in the Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts noted some improvements in the outlook, those in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts expect continued weakness. 
Travel and tourism activity contracted further in several reporting Districts, as households and businesses continued to scale back on discretionary and travel spending. Tourist spending in the New York, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts saw double-digit declines compared 
iv 
with the prior year. Airlines in the Dallas District and hotel contacts in the Kansas City District reported weakening demand for business travel, while the Atlanta District noted convention cancellations. Restaurants continued to see sluggish activity in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, which prompted further layoffs and closures in the latter region. In contrast, mountain resorts in the Richmond District said ski season demand was on par with last year, and cruise liners in the Atlanta District reported that deep discounting spurred bookings. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Housing markets remained depressed overall, but there were some signs that conditions may be stabilizing. Many Districts said factors such as homebuyer tax credits, low mortgage rates, and more affordable prices led to a rising number of potential buyers. The Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted a modest improvement in sales in some areas. 
New home construction activity fell further, however, as inventories remained elevated. Nonetheless, several Districts, including Atlanta and Kansas City, said that inventories of unsold homes had turned down slightly. 
Home prices continued to decline in most Districts, although a few reports noted that prices were unchanged or that the pace of decline had eased. Low mortgage rates were fueling refinancing activity. Outlooks for the housing sector were generally more optimistic than in earlier surveys, with respondents hopeful that increased buyer interest would lead to better sales. 
Nonresidential real estate conditions continued to deteriorate over the past six weeks. Demand for office, industrial and retail space continued to fall, and there were reports of increases in sublease space. Rental concessions were rising. Property values moved lower as reality “set in.” Construction activity continues to slow, and several Districts noted increased postponement of both private and public projects. Nonresidential construction is expected to decline through year-end, although there were some hopeful reports that the stimulus package may lead to some improvement. 
Commercial real estate investment activity weakened further. Contacts said a decline in credit availability and markdowns on commercial property were keeping buyers and sellers on the sidelines. 
v 
Banking and Finance 
Most Districts reported weaker loan demand overall, but the reports were mixed across loan categories. In particular, the New York, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts noted an increase in residential real estate loans. Additionally, residential refinancing activity remained brisk, although the loan process was taking longer due to more stringent appraisals and underwriting standards. Demand for commercial and industrial loans was weak, and there were several reports that business borrowers were postponing capital expenditures. Commercial real estate lending continued to decline. Credit availability generally remained very tight across regions. A number of Districts reported deteriorating loan quality and rising delinquencies for all types of loan categories. In particular, several reports noted more stringent requirements for commercial real estate loans due to worries of worsening loan quality in the sector. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Most regions reported improved planting and growing conditions, with the exception of the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, which are experiencing ongoing drought. Although beneficial, rainfall delayed field preparations for spring planting in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. Contacts in the Chicago District reported that producers had benefited from falling input prices, which are helping farmers obtain loans. Livestock producers in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts continued to be challenged by weak demand and low prices. Low milk prices have resulted in significant financial losses for dairy farmers in the Chicago and Dallas Districts, and have caused producers in the latter region to reduce their dairy cow herds. 
Reduced demand, rising inventories, and lower prices for oil and natural gas led to further declines in energy sector activity. Drilling activity fell sharply in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts; respondents in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts reported decreases as well. The Dallas District noted that the number of working U.S. rigs contracted by 300, and more than half of the decline was in Texas. In contrast, production was stable in the Cleveland District; gold mining is strong and wind energy projects moved ahead as planned in the Minneapolis District. Consistent with falling activity, the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted further layoffs in oil and gas extraction. Looking forward, energy contacts in the Cleveland District said that they intend to lower capital spending over the next few months. 
vi 
Prices 
Districts that report on prices noted downward pressures. Oil prices rose during the survey period, although most other commodity prices were stable to down. Manufacturers noted declines in the cost of raw materials and inputs, and product prices were generally said to be steady to down. Significant discounting was reported among retailers, and there were numerous examples of service providers reducing fees. In particular, accounting and legal firms in the Dallas District were responding to customer requests for lower fees, while the San Francisco District found prices were declining for professional services and lodging. Transportation service contacts noted a reduction in prices. 
Labor Markets and Wages 
Labor market conditions were weak and reports of layoffs, reductions in work hours, temporary factory shutdowns, branch closures and hiring freezes remained widespread across Districts. Staffing firms in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported that demand for workers remained sluggish. The manufacturing and energy extraction sectors were the most affected but there were numerous reports of job cuts in the retail and services industries as well. The St. Louis District reported payroll declines in information and medical services, while the Cleveland District cited layoffs in transportation and financial services. The Dallas District noted further cuts in the real estate and construction industry; layoffs at major financial firms continued in the New York District; and the Philadelphia District reported that unpaid furloughs had been instituted by state and local governments. In contrast, Districts including Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported some hiring in healthcare. Contacts in the Richmond District noted solid demand for technically-skilled professionals and IT and office-support workers. The Chicago and Dallas Districts saw a slight uptick in hiring of finance personnel due to the sharp increase in mortgage refinance activity. The St. Louis District reported that a food manufacturer and some wood and plastic manufacturers planned on expanding their operations and hiring additional staff. The employment outlook is generally bleak. Contacts in several Districts have instituted hiring freezes and anticipate further cuts in jobs and work hours. 
vii 
Continuing layoffs, furloughs and hiring freezes kept wage pressures minimal. Contacts from a broad range of industries reported pay freezes, with some noting salary reductions. The Minneapolis District reported that unionized faculty at Minnesota’s technical and community colleges had tentatively accepted a two-year pay freeze. Contacts in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts reported cuts in certain non-wage employment benefits, including cuts in bonuses, elimination or suspension of employer contributions to employee retirement programs, and increases in copayments on employer sponsored healthcare plans.",1,1
2009-04-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic 
conditions deteriorated further during the reporting period of January through late February. Ten of the twelve reports indicated weaker conditions or declines in economic activity; the exceptions were Philadelphia and Chicago, which reported that their regional economies “remained weak.” The deterioration was broad based, with only a few sectors such as basic food production and pharmaceuticals appearing to be exceptions. Looking ahead, contacts from various Districts rate the prospects for near-term improvement in economic conditions as poor, with a significant pickup not expected before late 2009 or early 2010. 
Consumer spending remained sluggish on net, although many Districts noted some improvement in January and February compared with a dismal holiday spending season. Travel and tourist activity fell noticeably in key destinations, as did activity for a wide range of nonfinancial services, with substantial job cuts noted in many instances. Reports on manufacturing activity suggested steep declines in activity in some sectors and pronounced declines overall. Conditions weakened somewhat for agricultural producers and substantially for extractors of natural resources, with reduced global demand cited as an underlying determinant in both cases. Markets for residential real estate remained largely stagnant, with only minimal and scattered signs of stabilization emerging in some areas, while demand for commercial real estate weakened significantly. Reports from banks and other financial institutions indicated further drops in business loan demand, a slight deterioration in credit quality for businesses and households, and continued tight credit availability. 
Upward price pressures continued to ease across a broad spectrum of final goods and services. This was largely associated with lower prices for energy and assorted raw materials compared with earlier periods, but also with weak final demand more generally, which spurred price discounting for items other than energy and food. With rising layoffs and hiring freezes, unemployment has risen in all areas, reducing or eliminating upward wage pressures. A number

ii 
of reports pointed to outright reductions in hourly compensation costs, through wage reductions and reduction or elimination of some employment benefits. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending remained very weak on balance, albeit with slight firming noted by many Districts, particularly compared with holiday-season sales that were very disappointing. About half of the Districts reported that consumer demand was softer than during recent reporting periods or fell significantly below levels twelve months earlier. However, compared with the preceding reporting period that included the holiday season, retail spending was described as “mixed” in the Boston and Richmond Districts, “nearly steady” in Philadelphia, and slightly improved in Cleveland and Dallas, while New York reported a reduced rate of decline compared with the “steep” pace in December. But San Francisco characterized retail sales as “anemic” and pointed to double-digit sales declines relative to twelve months earlier for many retail outlets. As reported by Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco, discount chains fared much better than traditional department stores and specialized retailers, recording sales gains in many cases as consumers continued to switch away from discretionary spending and luxury items and toward basic necessities. 
The weakness in discretionary spending was also reflected in relative sales by product type. Sales of luxury goods such as jewelry, electronic equipment, and other big ticket items were reported to be especially slow in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. Demand for furniture, appliances, and other durable household items remained quite depressed, according to Kansas City and San Francisco. Sales of new automobiles and light trucks remained exceptionally sluggish, with Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City reporting further declines from an already slow pace of sales. Used vehicles fared better in general, with Kansas City and San Francisco noting that they were selling well and Cleveland and Chicago reporting improvement over the previous period. Reports of gains in retail spending were largely limited to grocery stores and pharmacies, although reports from Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Richmond indicated some pickup in sales of apparel, which the latter District attributed in part to severe winter weather. 
Travel and tourist activity continued to fall in most areas, as households reduced their vacation travel and corporate travel spending was scaled back. Tourist visits and spending were 
iii 
reported to be slower than in the previous reporting period or down from twelve months earlier for major tourist destinations in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York, and San Francisco Districts, with the declines in the latter two characterized as “substantial” and “sharp,” respectively. Airline traffic fell in the Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Business at restaurants dropped substantially in some areas, notably in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, with extensive layoffs and restaurant closures reported in the latter. Nonfinancial Services 
Reports on nonfinancial services indicated significant drops in activity accompanied by widespread job cuts. Providers of health-care services reported falling patient volumes, which were attributed in part to a drop in elective procedures in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Demand continued to fall for professional services such as business consulting and accounting services, legal services, and other professional services in various Districts. However, Dallas noted a modest increase, albeit less-than-expected, in demand for legal services due to increased bankruptcy proceedings. Providers of information technology (IT) services in the Boston District saw a drop in activity on average, although some firms have sustained strong revenue growth; activity among providers of IT services was reported as stable to up in Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported that some IT services firms have seen solid demand from companies that are intent on using the technology to reduce costs. Demand for staffing services weakened considerably. Boston reported that outcomes for providers of temporary staffing services were “dismal,” with revenue declines in the range of 20 to 50 percent compared with twelve months earlier. Chicago and Dallas also reported sizable declines in activity by staffing firms, and New York noted that activity by a major employment agency has “virtually ground to a halt.” 
Demand for shipping and transportation services fell further. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta reported reduced activity and layoffs among trucking and rail companies, with the decline in activity described as considerable in some cases. Richmond also reported that shipping activity through ports in that District slowed further, as imports and exports both continued on a downward trend. 
Manufacturing 
iv 
Manufacturing activity fell on net in all Districts, with very sharp declines recorded for some sectors and only partial offsets provided by the few bright spots. Cleveland reported a drop in overall factory output of about 25 percent compared with twelve months earlier. For most Districts, the drop in activity was especially pronounced for makers of capital goods and construction-related equipment and materials, such as primary metals, wood products, and electrical equipment, along with consumer durables such as autos and furniture. Manufacturers of computers, semiconductors, and other IT products saw further declines in production and orders in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Slower export sales were cited as a source of weakness for various manufacturing sectors by the Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. 
Manufacturing of biotechnology products and pharmaceuticals was one bright spot, with Boston reporting sales gains at a double-digit pace for biopharmaceutical firms, Richmond noting continued hiring of temporary staff among life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and Chicago reporting continued strong demand for pharmaceuticals. Aircraft manufacturers in the St. Louis District are planning to expand existing production facilities; activity in this sector was largely stable in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts, but contacts expect some slowing in the future as airlines reduce capacity due to a slowdown in air travel. Food processers and manufacturers of selected chemicals also saw further increases in demand during the reporting period, according to Philadelphia and San Francisco. 
As a result of declining production, capacity utilization fell in most manufacturing sectors, with rates as low as 25 to 50 percent reported for some metal fabricators. Several Districts reported that capital spending plans were curtailed further during the reporting period, notably for companies in the retail sector and within manufacturing, which suggests the possibility of further reductions in orders for capital goods going forward. Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate markets remained in the doldrums in most areas, with only scattered, very tentative signs of stabilization reported. The pace of sales remained very low in most areas and declined further in some; most Districts reported small declines, but New York cited a sales drop of 60 to 65 percent in Manhattan compared with twelve months earlier. By contrast, Cleveland, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco each reported a rising or better-than- 
v 
expected sales pace for existing or new homes in some areas, attributed largely to falling prices and improved financing terms for some types of home mortgages. House prices continued to decline, reportedly at double-digit paces in some areas, with little or no signs of a deceleration evident. Builders in various Districts generally remain pessimistic regarding recovery prospects this year, and consequently the pace of new home construction declined further in most areas. 
Demand for commercial, industrial, and retail space fell further during the reporting period, with some evidence of more rapid deterioration than in preceding periods. Vacancy rates rose and lease rates declined on a widespread basis; New York noted that commercial real estate markets “weakened noticeably,” while Atlanta described reports on commercial real estate that were “decidedly more negative” than in previous periods. Construction activity has declined commensurately, and assorted reports suggest that market participants expect this weakness to continue at least through the end of 2009. Cleveland noted that public works projects have shown stability of late, although they declined in the San Francisco District as a result of the budgetary struggles of some state and local governments there. Credit constraints and uncertainty were reported to be a drag on commercial construction and leasing activity in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Banking and Finance 
Lending activity fell further on net, with mixed results across Districts and loan categories. Demand for commercial and industrial loans was reported to be lower in most Districts, although Philadelphia reported recent growth in this category. Consumer loan demand also fell in general, although Cleveland reported that it was “stable to up” during the reporting period. Demand for new mortgages remained depressed, but New York, Cleveland, and Richmond noted that refinancing activity continued at high levels or increased further. Boston and Cleveland reported that loan demand and the availability of funds were more favorable for community banks than for institutions with a national scope. 
The availability of credit generally remained tight. Lenders continued to impose strict standards for all types of loans, with scattered reports of further tightening and particular scrutiny focused on construction projects and commercial real estate transactions. Despite stringent standards, Atlanta and Chicago noted that funds were available for well-qualified applicants, and Dallas cited contacts who reported that capital has become more readily available. Credit quality 
vi 
fell for all loan categories, with declines cited by most Districts with the notable exception of Kansas City, where current loan quality was unchanged and expectations for future quality improved modestly. New York reported that the deterioration in quality was most pronounced for consumer loans, while Chicago emphasized deterioration in the quality of business loans as a result of rising bankruptcies. Scattered reports suggested improved liquidity in some credit markets and reductions in interest spreads, with Chicago noting that conditions for the commercial paper and corporate bond markets “improved significantly.” 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Conditions weakened for agricultural producers in various Districts, as demand fell and growing conditions were mixed. Sales slowed for a variety of tree and row crops, grains, dairy products, and livestock, and some product prices declined significantly. Dallas and Atlanta reported that sales were undermined by a drop in overseas demand, and the latter District also faced a sharp decline in demand for peanuts resulting from a recent salmonella outbreak at a processing plant. Planting and growing conditions were mixed within and across Districts, with adequate moisture and favorable temperatures reported for many areas but ongoing drought conditions and restricted water supplies noted by Dallas and San Francisco. Producers benefited from declining input prices on net, but these were not large enough to offset slower sales and lower product prices, which put downward pressure on profit margins and land values, according to Chicago and Kansas City. 
Activity slowed significantly for producers of natural resource products. Reduced global demand and lower prices for oil have prompted a sharp cutback in oil extraction activity since last fall, with Dallas noting an “unprecedented” decline in the domestic rig count that was largely concentrated in their District. Respondents from the Kansas City District expect oil extraction activity to fall further as the year proceeds, and Minneapolis noted that natural gas and mining activities also faltered during the reporting period. Prices and Wages 
Upward price pressures were very limited during the reporting period, as a result of lower energy and commodity prices and weak demand for final goods and services across a wide range of sectors. The lower prices of energy and raw materials generally were passed on and contributed to downward pressure on the final prices of various products, according to Chicago 
vii 
and Dallas. Prices dropped on selected retail items in the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, as discounting was widespread. Selected food products were a notable exception to downward price pressures, with Philadelphia reporting that some food processors raised their product prices. Gas prices rose, but according to Chicago and San Francisco the increase was not large enough to substantially offset the ongoing effects of the net decline from last year’s highs. 
Upward wage pressures eased in all Districts, as a rising incidence of hiring freezes and continued job cuts increased the degree of labor market slack. Contacts from various Districts pointed to a higher incidence of wage freezes resulting from the added slack, with a few noting outright wage reductions. Some employers also reduced compensation by lowering benefit costs, including reduced contributions to employee retirement programs, according to the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts.",1,1
2009-02-28,"Overall economic activity continued to weaken across almost all of the Federal Reserve Districts since the previous reporting period. Most Districts noted reduced or low activity across a wide range of industries, although a few Districts noted some exceptions in some sectors. 
District reports indicate that retail sales were generally weak, particularly during the holiday season. A majority of Districts noted deep discounting during the holiday sales season. Vehicle sales were also weak or down overall in the Districts reporting on them. Manufacturing activity decreased in most Districts. Declines were noted in a wide range of manufacturing industries, with a few exceptions. Services sector activity generally declined across the Districts, with exceptions in some sectors of the Boston, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. Additionally, several Districts noted weaker conditions in transportation services and slow or decreased demand in tourism activity. Conditions in residential real estate markets continued to worsen in most Districts. Reduced home sales, lower prices, or decreases in construction activity were noted in many Districts. Commercial real estate markets deteriorated in most Districts, with weakening construction noted in several Districts. Overall lending activity declined in several Districts, with tight or tightening lending conditions reported in most Districts. Credit quality remained a concern in several Districts. Agricultural conditions were mixed in response to varying weather conditions across the Districts. Mining and energy production activity generally declined since the previous report. 
Most Districts reported a general weakening of labor market conditions. Lower energy prices were noted in many of the Districts, and, except for the Richmond District, which mentioned higher prices for raw materials, most reporting Districts noted declining input prices. Wage pressures remained largely contained, and some Districts reported pay freezes or reductions in compensation.

ii 
Consumer Spending 
Reports of retail sales during the holiday season were generally negative in most Districts. Retail sales during the holiday season were weak or mostly down in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. However, some contacts in the Boston and New York Districts noted that sales picked up after the holidays. Retail sales in the Cleveland District were flat to down in November (on a month-over-month basis). Most retailers in the Richmond District had disappointing sales during the holiday season. Discount stores fared relatively better in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts, although discount stores in the Dallas District reported weak holiday sales. Deep discounting during the holiday season was reported in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Several Districts reported that luxury and big-ticket items (e.g., jewelry, appliances, and electronics) were weak sellers. Richmond reported that sales of gift cards were weaker than the previous year. In the New York District, cold-weather apparel was a relatively strong seller. Many retailers in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts expected continued weakness or sluggish sales. However, expectations were mixed in the Cleveland District, and retailers in the Boston District were watchful. 
Each of the ten Districts that reported on vehicle sales indicated that sales during the season were weak or down overall (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco). Sales of domestic brands were especially weak in the Richmond and Dallas Districts. Chicago reported increased demand for light trucks and San Francisco reported a slight increase in sales of larger used vehicles. Both of these changes were reported to be in response to falling gas prices. In addition, Dallas reported an increase in sales of used vehicles. Several Districts reported a negative outlook among car dealers. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity 
Manufacturing activity continued to fall in most Districts since the previous report, with declines reported across a wide range of industries. Cleveland noted a slump in steel shipping and Chicago noted 
iii 
that domestic steel production slowed. Dallas and Philadelphia indicated that industries related to construction experienced large drops in orders, and Richmond noted that import activity for construction and household products remains notably low. San Francisco reported that activity for producers of wood products remains depressed. Kansas City, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Dallas noted decreases in auto and auto-related manufacturing activity. Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that capacity utilization was below normal levels or declined. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Chicago, and Kansas City mentioned reductions in capital spending or plans to reduce capital spending in 2009. In contrast, firms in defense and medical-device production in the Minneapolis District reported increased activity, and San Francisco noted that aerospace manufacturing continued at a high level. Food manufacturing and processing remained active in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts and solid in the San Francisco District. 
Activity in the services sector declined throughout most Districts. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported slowed or declining activity for transportation services, often related to the shipping of construction and manufactured goods. San Francisco, St. Louis, New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported declines in travel or tourism-related services. Richmond and Atlanta noted that tourism activity was mixed, and Boston indicated that a majority of consulting and advertising firms reported stable to strong demand. Service activity at auto dealers continued to be robust in the Chicago District, and it increased in the Dallas District. Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate activity continued to weaken in nearly all Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported that home sales were weak or had declined. San Francisco reported that despite some pickup in recent months, home sales continued to be quite slow in most parts of the District. In the New York District, the market for new homes continued to weaken in New Jersey, and the higher-priced housing markets nearest to New York City were characterized as especially weak. While the Minneapolis District reported that late December saw an up- tick in residential sale activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, it was reportedly driven by foreclosures 
iv 
and short sales. Increased home sale cancellations were common in a few Districts. Contacts in the Dallas District reported that home sale cancellations remained prevalent, in some cases outpacing sales. Elevated cancellation rates and weak showroom traffic in the Chicago District led developers to remain cautious about expanding inventory levels, and some building contractors in the Cleveland District reported increased inventories because of take-backs from home sales that fell through. Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported that home prices continued to soften or fall. Median selling prices declined in and around New York City and were reported to have edged down in the Dallas District. Richmond, however, reported that home prices remained steady. 
Reporting Districts generally saw a decrease in homebuilding. Atlanta reported that homebuilders continued to pull back on home construction. The Philadelphia and Chicago Districts noted that residential building continued its decline. Residential construction was down in the St. Louis District, remained weak in Cleveland, and was quiet in Minneapolis. 
Commercial real estate markets deteriorated in most Districts. Contacts in the Boston District described the commercial real estate market as grim and depressing, and market conditions continued to deteriorate in Richmond. In the Minneapolis District, a contact noted that the market remained in a downturn that has now lasted more than a year. Commercial real estate transactions in the Dallas District have reportedly ground to a halt. Leasing activity was minimal in the Boston District, continued to fall in the Philadelphia District, and was assessed as ranging from slowing to frozen in the Richmond District. Contacts in the Chicago District reported increases in sublease space. Office and industrial leasing is expected to remain steady through the first half of 2009 in the St. Louis District, but San Francisco reported that conditions in their commercial office market remained exceptionally weak. The New York District reported that Manhattan’s office vacancy rate climbed to its highest level in two years. Contacts in the Chicago District noted elevated vacancy rates, and contacts in the Kansas City District expected higher vacancy rates going forward. Contacts in the Atlanta District also anticipate that more commercial space will become available. 
v 
Reports about commercial construction activity also were downbeat. In the Philadelphia District, commercial construction activity continued to fall. Cleveland reported that construction backlogs have declined for some contractors. Commercial contractors in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts reported declines in building activity and noted that more projects were cancelled or postponed. In St. Louis, contacts in commercial and industrial construction predicted a challenging environment in early 2009. San Francisco reported that commercial construction activity was very limited. Construction-related manufacturing contacts in the Dallas District reported that demand from commercial construction is shrinking rapidly. Banking and Finance 
Most Districts that reported on lending activity indicated that it continued to decline or remained weak, and many Districts reported that credit conditions remained tight or tightened further. Overall lending activity was reported to have slowed or declined in New York, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas; it remained soft or weak in the Chicago and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia reported a slow rise in outstanding loan volume with gains in real estate loans and consumer credit, but no business-loan growth. Demand for commercial loans was stable to decreasing in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts. Kansas City reported that demand fell for commercial and industrial loans, while San Francisco indicated that commercial and industrial loan volumes were at very low levels. In contrast, St. Louis reported a slight increase in commercial and industrial loans. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted an increase in residential mortgage refinancing activity. Demand for consumer loans declined in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. St. Louis reported an increase in loans to individuals. 
Regarding credit conditions, Boston reported that credit availability continues to be a major barrier to commercial real estate activity, and San Francisco noted that the availability of credit remains quite constrained. The New York and Atlanta Districts indicated a general tightening of credit standards, while Kansas City noted tighter standards for commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Credit standards were described as unchanged to tightening further by Cleveland and Richmond, while 
vi 
Dallas noted that depository institutions maintained tight credit standards. Chicago reported that credit conditions remained tight. Credit quality declined or remained a concern in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Default rates on commercial loans are expected to rise in the Boston District. Richmond indicated mixed reports on credit quality. Agriculture 
Weather conditions since the previous report had mixed effects on agricultural activity. Recent rain eased drought conditions in most of the Atlanta District, while parts of the Dallas District were still severely dry. Weather conditions allowed for fieldwork in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts but delayed fieldwork in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. The winter wheat crop in the Kansas City District was in good condition, while winter wheat development in the Richmond District was hindered by cooler temperatures and rain in recent weeks. The livestock sector in the Kansas City District and the poultry sector in the Atlanta District reported slowed activity, while production of red meat and some types of poultry decreased in the St. Louis District. The Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported that farm input costs (e.g., fuel and fertilizer) have moderated or declined recently. Dallas reported that commodity prices have dropped, but Chicago and Kansas City reported that corn and soybean prices have rebounded slightly. Natural Resource Industries 
Activity in the energy sector declined in several Districts since the previous report, with a number of Districts linking the decrease to lower energy prices. In the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts, oil and gas exploration declined. Kansas City reported a dramatic slowing in energy activity, and Dallas reported a decrease in drilling activity and a decline in the number of active oil rigs since the previous survey. In contrast, energy production did not change in the Cleveland District, and coal production in the St. Louis District was higher in December 2008 than in December 2007. Looking ahead, contacts in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts expect drilling activity to decline for the first few months of 2009. Regarding capital spending, contacts in the Atlanta District indicate that oil and gas exploration firms re-evaluated expansion plans in response to lower oil prices and difficulty obtaining credit. Energy producers in the 
vii 
Kansas City District are cutting capital budgets, but producers in the Cleveland District expect little change to their capital spending in early 2009. Finally, iron ore production in the Minneapolis District decreased since the previous report. Labor Markets 
Most Districts reported a general weakening of labor market conditions. Most Districts reported that layoffs continued, and Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas noted hiring freezes for select firms. Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas reported reduced hours to control costs. Job losses in the manufacturing sector were reported by contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Dallas noted that layoffs were becoming widespread in the energy industry, and New York noted that a substantial number of job reductions in the financial sector have yet to show up in payroll statistics. Richmond reported weaker demand for temporary workers. In contrast, contacts in Chicago indicated that demand for skilled workers remained strong. Richmond noted that demand was strongest for workers providing professional and support services, workers with high-level technical skills, and workers proficient in computer software. Chicago noted employment growth in the education, government, and healthcare fields. St. Louis also noted job growth in some small business support services firms. Cleveland reported continued hiring in defense-related and healthcare industries. Prices 
Consumers saw sizable holiday price cuts in retail stores in a majority of the Districts. Retail contacts in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported heavy holiday discounting. Retailers and restaurant contacts in the Kansas City District lowered prices and anticipated further declines in the months ahead. Lower energy prices were noted throughout many of the Districts. Most contacts in the Atlanta District reported reduced input price pressures, and about half of the contacts in manufacturing and related services in the Boston District reported falling input prices. Boston reported large price decreases for energy, oil-based materials, paper, and cotton in particular. In the Kansas City District, raw materials prices fell sharply, and manufacturers 
viii 
in general reported a corresponding decline in finished product prices. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia District also reported decreases in commodity prices and some reported a reduction in the prices of their own products as well. Contacts in the Cleveland District observed that the downward trend in raw materials prices has started to level off and that pricing of manufactured products remained relatively stable. On the other hand, the Richmond District noted that raw materials prices rose at a slightly quicker pace since last reported. Contacts in the San Francisco District reported that they expect upward price pressures to remain very limited during early 2009. 
Wages 
Wage pressures remained largely contained in most Districts. The Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported little to no wage pressures. Richmond noted that wage gains in the retail sector held up, but average wage increases slowed for service firms. Wage increases were modest in the Minneapolis District, and wage pressures diminished in the Kansas City District. A few Districts experienced slowing wage gains in sectors that had previously seen rapid wage advances, notably the energy sector in the Cleveland District and the technology sector in the San Francisco District. According to reports from the New York District, year-end bonuses at financial firms are seen falling 20 to 30 percent from a year ago at some of the smaller firms but more substantially at the larger establishments. The Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts also noted that some contacts are enacting or considering pay freezes or reductions in compensation.",1,0
2008-11-30,"Reports indicated that economic activity weakened in September across all twelve Federal Reserve Districts. Several Districts also noted that their contacts had become more pessimistic about the economic outlook. 
Consumer spending decreased in most Districts, with declines reported in retailing, auto sales and tourism. Nearly all Districts commenting on nonfinancial service industries noted reduced activity. Manufacturing slowed in most Districts. Residential real estate markets remained weak, and commercial real estate activity slowed in many Districts. Credit conditions were characterized as being tight across the twelve Districts, with several reporting reduced credit availability for both financial and nonfinancial institutions. District reports on agriculture and natural resources were mostly positive, although adverse weather associated with hurricanes Ike and Gustav negatively affected the South and the Midwest. 
Inflationary pressures moderated a bit in September. While several Districts noted continuing pass-through of earlier price increases for metals, food and energy, most indicated that cost pressures had eased. Labor market conditions weakened in most Districts, and wage pressures remained limited. Several Districts reported lower capital spending or reductions in capital spending plans due to the high level of uncertainty about the economic outlook or concerns over the availability of credit. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism. Consumer spending was softer in nearly all Districts. Retail sales were reported to have weakened or declined in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City; Dallas and San Francisco cited weak or sluggish sales; and Boston and New York indicated that sales were mixed and moderately below plan sales, respectively. Several Districts noted a reduction in discretionary spending by consumers and lower sales on big-ticket items. Several also reported increased activity at discount stores as consumers became more price conscious and shifted purchases toward less-expensive brands. Retailers cited these recent sales trends and concerns about credit availability as reasons for a weaker

ii 
economic outlook, including a slow holiday season. Most Districts reporting on light vehicle sales saw declines, with several Districts pointing to reduced credit availability as a limiting factor for automobile sales. However, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago noted that dealers offering incentive and discount programs had seen some positive effect on sales. Tourism was mixed or weaker for tourist destinations on the East and West coasts, while both Minneapolis and Atlanta indicated that increases in international travelers were helping to offset lower domestic travel. 
Business Spending. Hiring and capital spending varied across Districts. Labor market conditions weakened in most Districts. Boston, Chicago and Richmond cited reductions in hiring or hiring plans. Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco and Dallas all noted some weakening in employment. However, the demand for skilled labor remained strong in several Districts, and Kansas City noted market tightness for minimum-wage jobs in leisure and hospitality. Several Districts reported that capital spending decisions were being influenced by economic uncertainty. New York, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco noted weaker capital spending. Boston reported capital spending was mixed as firms were cautious about spending resources. Cleveland reported capital spending remained on plan but intentions to increase outlays have declined. Philadelphia indicated concerns over restrictions in access to credit were limiting future capital expenditures for some manufacturers. In contrast, Kansas City and Chicago reported that capital spending for producers of heavy machinery continued to be strong. 
Nonfinancial Services. Nonfinancial service industries experienced weaker activity in most Districts. Several Districts reported that activity in real-estate and related industries such as legal and title services was weak. New York cited widespread deterioration in business conditions. Boston reported consulting firms were experiencing reduced demand for their services from a range of clients. Cleveland, St. Louis, and Dallas noted slower activity in the transportation industry; however, Dallas’ slowdown was due mostly to temporary disruptions caused by hurricane Ike. Trucking contacts in Atlanta indicated declines in retail, automotive, and construction-related shipments, but increases in energy and farm products. Minneapolis reported continued strength in professional business services, while demand for professional business services was 
iii 
down in San Francisco and Philadelphia. Demand for healthcare-related services was strong in Boston, Richmond, and Chicago, but weaker in St. Louis and San Francisco. Staffing firms reported lower demand for their services in Richmond, Philadelphia, and Chicago, but noted steady demand in Dallas. 
Manufacturing. Manufacturing activity moved lower in most Districts, and contacts expressed heightened concern about the economic outlook. Several Districts noted that credit conditions were contributing to a high level of uncertainty on the part of contacts. Declines in manufacturing activity of varying degrees were reported in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, San Francisco, and Dallas. Atlanta reported that production remained at a low level, while Minneapolis described conditions as mixed and Philadelphia noted a slight increase in activity. Metals-related industries, including the domestic steel industry, reported slower activity, although overall levels of production were still high in several Districts. Producers of housing-related items, building materials and construction equipment continued to experience low levels of demand across the twelve Districts. Activity in the automotive industry also continued to decline. Kansas City, Richmond, Philadelphia and Chicago reported continued strength in exports. However, Atlanta indicated a decline in export orders, reversing a trend of the past several months. Energy-related manufacturers and heavy equipment manufacturers with ties to energy or agriculture continued to do well in most Districts. Dallas and Atlanta reported that hurricanes Ike and Gustav disrupted oil production and refining, restricting the supply of petroleum and related products and leading to gasoline shortages in the Southeast and along the East coast. 
Real Estate and Construction. Residential real estate and construction activity weakened or remained low in all Districts. Housing activity was reported to have moved lower in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. While still slow, residential markets showed some signs of stabilizing in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City. Several Districts noted continuing downward price pressures and an increasing supply of homes for sale due to rising foreclosures. However, the inventory of unsold homes was reported to have declined in areas of the Boston and Atlanta Districts as well as in Philadelphia and Cleveland. Tighter credit conditions were cited as a limiting factor for demand in several Districts. Most Districts 
iv 
reported commercial real estate and construction activity had slowed, with New York, San Francisco and Dallas noting the sharpest declines. In contrast, Cleveland and St. Louis indicated steady activity. Increases in vacancy rates or sublease space were noted in Chicago, Boston, New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Several Districts reported project delays and cancellations due to tighter credit conditions and increased economic uncertainty. 
Banking and Finance. Credit conditions tightened in all the Districts that reported on them. Bank lending was described as either stable or lower for both consumers and businesses. Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted that loan quality had deteriorated. Credit standards were tightened, particularly for commercial and residential real estate loans, in several Districts. Several also indicated that lenders in their District had become more highly cautious and more conservative. Richmond noted increased scrutiny of loan applications by banks and higher collateral requirements on commercial lending, and Cleveland and New York cited increases in loan pricing. Some Districts also mentioned customers taking steps to ensure that existing deposits are covered by insurance and noted deposit withdrawals after reports of bank closings during September. Liquidity problems in inter-bank markets along with a higher cost of funds were reported in several Districts. As a result, Chicago reported that banks were increasingly utilizing alternative sources of funds like the discount window and the brokered CD market; and Kansas City noted that banks had become more cautious in their liquidity management. Several Districts cited reports from businesses of difficulties in obtaining credit. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Agricultural conditions remained favorable in most of the Districts reporting on them. Corn and soybean harvests were somewhat behind schedule in Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Heavier precipitation slowed the harvests in some Districts, but aided agriculture in Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. Drought continued to be a problem in parts of the Atlanta District, and hurricanes damaged agriculture in parts of the Dallas District. Yield projections slipped since the summer, but were still expected to be near historical averages. Livestock producers faced tighter margins due to high feed costs and problems with feed availability in some Districts. Most agricultural product prices fell in 
September. Exports continued to boost agricultural demand, while domestic demand lagged for some commodities. Conditions for the energy and mining sectors were positive, except for temporary damage to infrastructure from the recent hurricanes. Disruptions to offshore oil drilling in Dallas were not as extensive as they were after other recent major hurricanes. Drilling in the U.S. increased, especially for natural gas. Coal prices were stable, while oil and natural gas prices declined. Even so, energy operations looked to expand in Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. In addition, Minneapolis reported new mining activity. 
Prices and Wages. Most Districts reported that cost pressures on prices had eased, although a number of Districts noted that the costs of energy, raw materials, food, and transportation remain elevated and margins were tight. Manufacturers in New York said that they plan selling price increases; but, with activity weakening, fewer other businesses anticipate price increases. Dallas noted that businesses facing softer demand plan to pass cost reductions on to customers, and Cleveland cited a decline in fuel surcharges as gasoline prices fell. However, respondents in Chicago and Dallas also reported that they continued efforts to pass-through earlier cost increases. Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco noted increased discounting by retailers; Richmond reported that retail prices were rising less quickly; and Kansas City reported only a slight rise in retail prices. On the other hand, retailers in Chicago and Kansas City expect to raise prices further in coming months, and some in San Francisco also anticipate that the cost increases in train will lead to higher retail prices later this year and in 2009. Wage pressures across the twelve Districts remained limited outside of skilled labor positions that continue to experience high demand, such as the energy industry in Cleveland, Dallas, and Kansas City.",0,0
2008-10-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the pace of economic activity has been slow in most Districts. Many described business conditions as “weak,” “soft,” or “subdued.” Cleveland and St. Louis reported some weakening since their last reports while Boston and New York noted signs of stabilization. Kansas City reported a slight improvement. 
Consumer spending was reported to be slow in most Districts, with purchasing concentrated on necessary items and retrenchment in discretionary spending. Districts reporting on auto sales described them as falling or steady at low levels. Tourism activity was mixed but received support from international visitors in several Districts, and the demand for services eased in most Districts. The transportation industry was also adversely affected by rising fuel costs. Manufacturing activity declined in most Districts but improved somewhat in Minneapolis and Kansas City. Most Districts reported that residential real estate markets remained soft. Commercial real estate activity was slow in most Districts, and some reported further slackening in demand for office and retail space. Most Districts reported easing loan demand, especially for residential mortgages and consumer loans; lending to businesses was mixed. Districts reporting on the agricultural sector noted some relief from drought conditions. Districts reporting on energy and mining activity recorded increased activity. 
Almost all Districts continued to report price pressures from elevated costs of energy, food, and other commodities, although some noted that there have been declines

ii 
or slower increases in prices for several industrial commodities and energy products. Business contacts in a number of Districts indicated that they had increased selling prices in response to the high costs for their inputs. Wage pressures were characterized as moderate by most Districts amid a general pullback in hiring, although several Districts noted continued strong demand for workers in the energy sector. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending was slow in most Districts. Retail sales and other consumer spending was reported as mixed or little changed in Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas and weak or declining in Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Sales were described as below expectations in Atlanta but on or close to plan in New York. Cleveland and Kansas City noted some improvement in retail sales since the last report. Several Districts reported that consumers were concentrating on food, staples, and other necessary items while reducing spending on discretionary items. Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reported noticeable declines in spending on apparel, electronics, and jewelry. Sales of furniture and household appliances were weak in most Districts. San Francisco described sales of this merchandise as exceptionally poor. A shift of consumer shopping patterns toward discount stores and lower-price brands and away from traditional department and specialty stores was observed in Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. Sales of motor vehicles were reported to be weak or falling in all Districts, especially for larger, less fuel-efficient cars, SUVs, and trucks. 
Tourism activity varied across Districts. Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported mixed or steady conditions since the last report. Boston, New York, and Richmond reported improvement since the last report. San Francisco reported that 
iii 
tourism was flat to down in most major destinations in that District, significantly so in Hawaii. International visitors boosted tourism in Boston, New York, and Minneapolis. In contrast, several Districts noted that domestic vacationers appeared to be reducing miles traveled and amounts spent on trips. Boston reported that business travel has been better than expected. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Districts reporting on nonfinancial services generally indicated some slowing in activity since the last report, although New York reported stabilization after several months of decline. Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas noted falling demand for freight and transportation services, and firms in those industries reported higher fuel costs negatively affecting their margins. Dallas reported that airlines were reducing capacity. Demand for information technology services was reported to be flat in Boston and down in St. Louis. St. Louis and San Francisco noted less strength in the health care sector since the last report. Business and professional services activity was weakening in St. Louis and San Francisco. Dallas reported that business was steady at accounting firms but down at legal firms. Temporary staffing activity was reported to be mixed in Boston and Richmond and stable in Dallas. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity was weak or declining in most Districts but improved in others. New York reported some stabilization after months of decline, Kansas City reported a rebound after a weakening in June, and Minneapolis and San Francisco have made gains since the last report. A number of Districts reported that export orders were bolstering manufacturing activity, but manufacturers in several of those Districts have 
iv 
noted some recent slowing in growth from this source. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas reported continuing declines in demand for housing- related products and construction materials. Boston reported declining output of aircraft and other transportation parts and equipment, but San Francisco reported a high rate of aircraft production. Output of motor vehicles and related products was falling in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Boston and San Francisco reported rising demand for information technology equipment, but Dallas reported some weakening in demand for high-technology products. Manufacturers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City have increased capital spending or plan to do so, but Boston reported that manufacturers in that District were reexamining capital spending plans, and Chicago reported that several firms were postponing capital projects. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate conditions weakened or remained soft in all Districts, except Kansas City, which reported a modest increase in sales since the last report. Demand for housing was reported to be still moving down in Boston, New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Residential real estate activity was sluggish in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas. New York reported low levels of single-family construction but a brisk pace of multi-family construction after an increase in permits in June occasioned by a change in the New York building code effective July 1. Chicago reported a faster rate of decline in residential construction since the last report as well as delays and cancellations in residential building projects. Richmond and Kansas City reported that lower and mid-price houses 
v 
were selling at a better rate than more expensive houses. Atlanta and Dallas reported that inventories of unsold new houses were edging down. 
Commercial real estate activity moved down or remained weak in all Districts except Dallas. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago reported signs of softening demand for commercial real estate, including declining leasing activity, rising vacancies, and decreasing construction. Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported that commercial real estate market conditions varied across those Districts but in general were not strong. Dallas reported an increase in office leasing but at a slower pace than in the last report. Chicago and Minneapolis noted drops in demand for retail space. Dallas and San Francisco reported that public projects were buoying construction activity. Banking and Finance 
District reports on bank lending generally indicated steady or slowing growth, with weakening demand for residential mortgages and consumer loans and near steady demand for commercial and industrial loans. Residential mortgage lending fell in New York and Richmond, remained slow in Chicago and Dallas, but gained slightly in Philadelphia. Consumer lending was flat to down in Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis and showed little change in New York and Chicago. Commercial and industrial lending was near steady in New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland and eased in Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose in Chicago— mostly from small and mid-size firms—and was described as solid in Dallas. San Francisco reported that overall loan demand has fallen since the previous report. All the Districts reporting on loan standards noted tightening. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, 
vi 
and San Francisco reported deterioration in credit quality. Dallas indicated that credit quality was holding up, although bankers in that District expected it to decline. Districts reporting on bank funding noted that competition for deposits remained strong. In Dallas, bankers said they were pursuing nondeposit sources of liquidity. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
The agricultural sector continued to struggle under drought conditions in the South, although there was some relief in July and August. In the Richmond District persistent dry conditions were expected to delay crop development and reduce yields; however, the fruit and vegetable harvests have been mostly completed. Atlanta reported some benefit from recent rains, although drought conditions persisted in Georgia. Chicago reported improved crop conditions, although corn and soybean development was behind schedule. Crop development was also behind schedule in the St. Louis District where conditions improved for grain but worsened for cotton. Minneapolis reported a better than expected harvest of winter wheat and expectations that corn production would exceed last year’s harvest. Dallas reported dry conditions in much of the District and noted that Hurricane Dolly destroyed cotton and sorghum in the Rio Grande valley. Kansas City reported an increase in wheat yields. Although most Districts with significant agricultural sectors reported strong demand for their products, they also noted that fuel, feed, and fertilizer costs had risen, putting pressure on profit margins. High costs were reported for livestock operations, and Kansas City and Dallas reported that herds were being culled. 
Energy and mining activity were strong and expanding in all of the Districts that reported on these sectors. Cleveland noted increases in oil, gas, and coal extraction since 
vii 
the last report. Minneapolis also reported an increase in energy activity and indicated that almost all mines in the District were operating at full capacity. Drilling activity has increased in the Kansas City District since the last report and was well above the year- ago level. Dallas reported a continued rise in the rig count, to levels above last year, with much of the increase due to drilling for natural gas. San Francisco noted an increase in petroleum production. 
Prices and Wages 
All Districts reported continuing upward price pressure from elevated input costs, although several noted recent retreats in some commodity and energy prices. Philadelphia reported rising prices for food products, industrial materials, and metals. Cleveland reported continuing increases in raw material costs, and business contacts in San Francisco said upward price pressure remained significant. Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas business contacts noted recent declines in commodity and energy prices but said price levels remained high. In Philadelphia, retailers reported rising wholesale costs. Retail price inflation edged up in Richmond. New York and Chicago reported little change in retail prices. Business contacts in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas indicated that high prices for their inputs were leading them to step up the pass-through of higher costs to their selling prices. Similar reports of the pass-through of costs to prices came from manufacturers in the Boston and New York Districts as well as from shippers in the Cleveland District. Chicago and San Francisco reported that the pass-through of costs to prices was more limited. 
Labor market conditions were unchanged or somewhat softer in most Districts compared with the last report. Wage increases were typically characterized as moderate. 
viii 
Boston reported mostly modest wage increases except for greater hikes in salaries at information technology companies. Philadelphia reported moderate wage gains and limited hiring. Cleveland noted wage pressures in the energy sector but not in manufacturing or construction. Atlanta received scattered reports of wage increases, mainly in the professional services and the energy sectors, and more generally in coastal areas undergoing rebuilding after storm damage. Chicago indicated that labor markets have weakened and there was little wage pressure other than for a few skilled trades. Kansas City reported steady wage pressure but noted that there were shortages of qualified workers in the energy sector. Dallas also noted shortages of workers in the energy sector but indicated that wage pressure was mild overall. San Francisco reported some easing in upward wage pressure as firms in that District have been reducing staff counts, although demand remained strong for skilled workers in the resource extraction and information technology industries.",1,0
2008-08-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the pace of economic activity slowed somewhat since the last report. Five eastern Districts noted a weakening or softening in their overall economies, while Chicago characterized its economy as sluggish and Kansas City noted a moderation in growth. St. Louis said activity was stable and San Francisco reported little or no growth. Cleveland and Minneapolis reported slight increases in economic activity, while Dallas described growth as steady and moderate. 
Consumer spending was reported as sluggish or slowing in nearly all Districts, although tax rebate checks boosted sales for some items. Tourist activity was mixed, with residents in several Districts choosing to vacation closer to home due to high gasoline prices. The demand for services was also mixed across Districts, with strength in the IT and health care industries offsetting some weakness in other service sectors. Manufacturing activity declined in many Districts, although demand for exports remained generally high. Residential real estate markets declined or were still weak across most of the country. Commercial real estate activity also slowed or remained sluggish in a majority of Districts, although a few Districts noted slight improvement. In banking, loan growth was generally reported to be restrained, with residential real estate lending and consumer lending showing more weakness than commercial lending. Districts reporting on agricultural activity said conditions were mixed, based largely on how June precipitation affected them. Districts reporting on the energy sector said it continued to strengthen.

ii 
All reporting Districts characterized overall price pressures as elevated or increasing. Input prices continued to rise, particularly for fuel, other petroleum-based materials, metals, food, and chemicals. Retail price inflation varied across the country, with some Districts reporting increases but others noting some stability, at least for the present. Wage pressures were generally limited in most Districts, as labor market demand was soft except for highly skilled workers and in the energy sector. Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending was reported as mixed, weak, or slowing in nearly all Districts since the last report, although tax rebate checks boosted sales for some items, especially electronics. Cleveland was an exception to the trend, characterizing sales as stable to improving outside of the grocery sector. Sales at discount stores were also reported as growing in the Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and New York reported brisk sales in New York City. However, sales at most other types of stores, especially for discretionary and housing-related items, were typically characterized as weak or falling, and restaurant sales were also reported as slow in the Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts. The outlook for retail activity was also generally downbeat, with expectations “subdued” among Atlanta District contacts and “grim” among Dallas District contacts. Despite sluggish overall sales, inventories were reported as largely satisfactory in most Districts. 
Reports on automobile sales were almost uniformly weak across Districts. Sales were especially poor for large vehicles such as trucks, SUVs, and some minivans. Indeed, auto dealers in the San Francisco District were increasingly reluctant to accept trade-ins of trucks and SUVs due to a lack of a wholesale market for these vehicles. Demand for small fuel-efficient and foreign vehicles was reported to be solid or increasing in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
iii 
Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. Dallas reported that consumers were paying sticker prices for such vehicles, and that they were in short supply. 
Tourist activity was mixed across Districts. Contacts in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts reported weakness, and San Francisco said travel to Hawaii declined noticeably. Atlanta also noted increased hotel cancellations and shorter trip durations, although convention business remained strong. By contrast, tourist activity to mountain areas of the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts was characterized as stronger, which some contacts attributed in part to more residents vacationing close to home due to high gasoline prices. New York also reported strong tourism activity in New York City, including for Broadway shows and at Manhattan hotels. Nonfinancial Services 
The demand for services was mixed among the various Districts, with strength in the IT and health care industries offsetting some weakness in other service sectors. Advertising and marketing firms in the Boston District experienced robust demand from the tourism and retail industries, and St. Louis reported the addition of two new call centers in the area. Dallas noted particularly strong demand for accounting, energy, engineering, and IT services. On the negative side, New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported services activity as mixed or decreasing. San Francisco noted “grim” conditions for real estate services such as title insurance, and some service firms in the New York District expressed caution about hiring due to ongoing turmoil in the financial industry. In transportation services, New York, Atlanta, and Dallas reported weaker activity due to higher fuel costs, while Cleveland said activity remained unchanged and Richmond indicated an increase in shipping volume. New York said fuel, as opposed to labor, was now the number one cost for trucking firms and that most surcharges were 
iv 
considered inadequate to defray the escalated costs. Cleveland reported that many trucking firms had reduced capital spending, with little change expected in coming months. Atlanta and Dallas noted a decline in auto and construction materials shipments. Most services contacts expected flat activity heading forward. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity declined or remained weak in most Districts, although Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported stable or slightly increasing activity. Many Districts reported a decline in production of housing-related goods, such as construction equipment, wood products, home furnishings, and HVAC units. The Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts all reported declines in auto manufacturing activity. However, St. Louis noted a slight rise in demand for parts of small and hybrid-type cars. An equipment producer in the Richmond District cited reduced sales due to interrupted shipments caused by higher gas prices and restrictive truck schedules. On the positive side, producers of energy equipment saw increased demand in several Districts, and Minneapolis noted a rise in orders for wind turbine parts. San Francisco said that food manufacturers continued to operate at or near peak capacity due to persistently high demand. Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City reported continued high demand for exports. Dallas noted strong overseas sales of high-tech products in Asia, but cited weak demand in Western Europe. Some manufacturers in the Boston District cited examples of robust demand in foreign markets, while others said foreign demand growth may be slowing. Manufacturers in several Districts anticipated further factory weakness in the near future. While most Districts expected stable capital spending heading forward, a few noted manufacturers’ plans to reevaluate based on current economic conditions. 
v 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate markets declined or were still weak across most of the country. Slower home sales were reported in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts. Cleveland reported flat to declining sales, while sales remained sluggish in the Kansas City and New York Districts—especially at the high end—and were below year-ago levels in the Minneapolis District. New York also reported a drop in Manhattan condo and co-op transactions. Inventories of unsold homes or condos were reported as higher or excessive in several Districts, but Dallas noted a continued decline in inventories, especially at the low end. Home prices continued to decline in most Districts, and increased use of incentives and discounting was noted in several Districts. San Francisco noted particularly sharp declines in home prices in areas of California, Arizona, and Nevada that have experienced large increases in foreclosures. Atlanta said home prices dropped across the board. On the other hand, home prices were said to be holding up in the Dallas District and were little changed in the Kansas City District. Difficulties obtaining mortgage financing were reported in the New York and Chicago Districts. All Districts reporting on single-family construction said activity continued to decline, and builders in the Philadelphia District noted a rising number of cancellations. The decline in new construction accelerated in some areas of the Chicago District. 
Commercial real estate activity weakened or remained sluggish in a majority of Districts, although Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted some improvement. Boston characterized sentiment in the sector as “decidedly morose,” and industrial markets were especially weak in that District. Office market conditions in the Richmond District continued to weaken and were “bleak” in the Washington, DC area. Vacancy rates increased in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts, and were up noticeably in both Midtown and Downtown 
vi 
Manhattan, according to contacts in the New York District. Office rents remained steady in the Philadelphia District, and were little changed in the Boston District after taking concessions into account. More positively, contacts in the Minneapolis District noted rent increases and positive absorption in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area office market. Districts reporting on nonresidential construction generally noted sluggishness, which contacts in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts attributed in part to prohibitively high construction costs. Contractors in the Cleveland District were also worried about cuts but reported strong backlogs and a steady flow of inquiries. Contacts in many Districts also cited tightened financing as a constraint. San Francisco noted particularly steep drops in commercial construction in the San Diego area. Retail space was described as overbuilt in the Boston and Chicago Districts. 
Banking and Finance 
Loan growth was generally reported to be restrained across the country, with residential real estate lending and consumer lending showing more weakness than commercial lending. Overall loan demand was reported to have weakened in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, and was described as sluggish in the Philadelphia District. St. Louis reported slightly positive overall loan demand. A number of Districts reported sluggish growth or slowing demand for residential real estate loans, and San Francisco described demand for such loans as very weak. Consumer loan demand was reported to have declined in the New York, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, and grew more slowly in the Philadelphia District. Reports on business lending were generally more upbeat. However, slight to moderate declines in business lending were reported in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. On the funding side, Dallas described competition for deposits as very tough, but Cleveland 
vii 
indicated that core deposits at smaller banks were stable to increasing as a result of a flight to safety by investors. 
Most Districts reported a further tightening of credit standards, especially for residential real estate and construction loans. Dallas reported that lenders were tightening non-price terms and boosting loan spreads in response to increases in their cost of capital. Tighter standards for construction loans were reported in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts, and San Francisco indicated that credit standards remained quite restrictive for both residential real estate and construction loans. Tighter standards for business loans were reported in three Districts, but banks in the Atlanta District were reported to be competing more intensely for business customers with good credit histories. Kansas City and Boston reported that tightened standards were especially prevalent on commercial real estate loans. 
Among the Districts that commented on bank loan quality, some deterioration was reported, including in the Philadelphia, Richmond and San Francisco Districts. New York reported increased delinquencies on consumer and residential real estate loans, and San Francisco indicated that declines in loan quality were greatest for real estate loans and construction loans. In the Dallas District, contacts had not yet observed a significant decline in loan quality but expected deterioration in coming months, especially for residential real estate and consumer loans. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural conditions were mixed across Districts following June precipitation, while high input costs trimmed profits. Drought conditions eased in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts with increased rainfall. However, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported that cool, wet weather delayed corn and soybean 
viii 
development, and Chicago cited major crop losses due to flooding. Heavy rains also delayed the winter wheat harvests in the Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts, although initial reports indicated average or above average wheat yields. San Francisco noted robust agricultural export activity, but wildfires hindered growing conditions in that District. Most Districts reported concerns about higher input costs. Kansas City attributed slightly lower farm income expectations and increased agricultural loan demand to these higher costs. Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas also indicated that livestock producers were struggling with higher feed costs. 
Energy activity strengthened further with rising energy prices. Oil and natural gas drilling remained strong in the Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, with expectations of further exploration. In the search for new energy sources, Dallas noted increased drilling activity toward unconventional natural gas sources, and Kansas City cited rising interest in tapping shale oil deposits. Minneapolis stated that wind farm development continued, although ethanol production slowed with higher corn prices. Mining activity increased in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts. Cleveland indicated that equipment costs were rising, while the lack of equipment constrained oil and gas production in the Kansas City District. Prices and Wages 
All reporting Districts characterized overall price pressures as elevated or increasing. Input prices continued to rise, particularly for fuel, other petroleum-based materials, metals, food, and chemicals. Chicago said the rate of growth in steel prices had flattened, but overall levels remained high. Construction industry contacts in the Cleveland District noted rising prices for all types of products, including concrete, shingles, and steel. Boston reported that contacts were anticipating further price increases in oil derivatives, shipping, and travel. Many Districts 
ix 
reported on manufacturers’ plans to raise selling prices as a result of higher input prices, with several commenting on fears of a corresponding decrease in customer demand and overall sales volume. Several firms in the Philadelphia District indicated that sluggish demand has made it difficult to raise prices, and Atlanta District businesses were hesitant to pass-through increases due to a reduction in discretionary consumer spending. One producer in the Richmond District indicated that his company would attempt to pass along price increases to customers but it may not be enough to offset cost increases. Retail prices increased in several Districts, including in the Kansas City District—which reported an increase in hotel, restaurant, and resort prices—and in the Chicago District, where retailers said they raised selling prices in response to higher wholesale prices. On the other hand, New York and Cleveland reported relatively stable retail prices. San Francisco also reported that final prices for many retail items were stable or down, partly due to extensive discounting, although some contacts noted that pressures were likely to increase in coming months. One major retail chain in the New York District said that while costs under existing contract were not up substantially, some escalation in prices was expected within the next year. 
Most Districts reported labor markets as unchanged or slightly weaker compared with the last survey period, and that wage pressures were generally modest. Demand for labor remained high for skilled workers in most industries, while several Districts reported widespread weakness in the financial services, auto, and construction industries. Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts reported very little upward wage pressures, with the exception of the energy and skilled labor markets. San Francisco noted some downward movement in wages for construction, finance, real estate, and retail jobs. But Boston and Dallas said more workers were requesting wage adjustments to supplement cost of living increases.",0,0
2008-07-31,"Reports from the Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity remained generally weak in late April and May. Three Districts described economic activity as softer, weaker, or lower, with an additional four Districts reporting slower, sluggish, or modest economic growth. The remaining five Districts of Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco described activity as stable or little changed in recent weeks. 
Consumer spending slowed since the last report as incomes were pinched by rising energy and food prices. Higher energy prices also appeared to damp domestic tourism. Reports on nonfinancial services varied across Districts and industries. Manufacturing activity was generally soft in recent weeks, with weak demand for housing-related and some other products but with increasing demand for exports. Residential real estate markets remained weak across most Districts. Commercial real estate conditions varied across Districts, as did reports on nonresidential construction activity. Lending activity also varied across Districts and market segments, though tighter credit standards were reported for most loan categories. Districts reporting on the agriculture and energy sectors noted improved crop conditions and increased drilling and extraction activity. 
Reports of higher input costs were widespread. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts noted some ability to pass along higher costs to customers. Retailers reported mixed results with respect to raising final goods prices. In most Districts, wage pressures

ii 
were reported as moderate or limited for all but a few skilled-labor positions, as hiring activity remained spotty in most Districts. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism. Consumer spending slowed further since the last report. Contacts in several Districts said rising energy and food prices contributed to softer sales in other categories. The overall pace of retail sales moderated in the Districts of Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco, and was level in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City. Retail sales reports were mixed in Boston and New York. According to contacts, retail inventory levels were generally higher in the Atlanta District and among some types of stores in San Francisco; some establishments in the New York, St. Louis, and Richmond Districts expressed concerns about inventory levels. In the Boston District retail inventories were stable. Employment was on the whole unchanged at Boston District retailers, whereas retailers in the Cleveland District said they were only hiring for new stores, and Richmond District retail contacts reported job cuts. 
Reports on overall sales of automobiles and light trucks were weak, with several Districts indicating that sales of trucks and SUVs declined. Although dealers generally struggled to move vehicles off of their lots, contacts in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported solid sales of hybrid and other fuel-efficient vehicles. 
Tourist activity varied across Districts. New York contacts said that tourist activity had softened, noting lower attendance at Broadway theaters. San Francisco reported weaker hotel bookings in Southern California and in Hawaii, but record hotel occupancy rates in parts of Alaska. Higher gasoline prices appeared to weaken tourism activity in the Chicago District, but increased activity at some resorts in the Richmond 
iii 
District as families took vacations closer to home. International visitors boosted tourism activity in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. 
Nonfinancial Services. Reports from nonfinancial services industries varied among Districts. New York and Minneapolis reported weaker business conditions while contacts in the Richmond District reported slower revenue growth, except in telecommunications. Demand growth for service providers slowed in the San Francisco District. Demand at services businesses in Boston and Chicago, however, was mixed and the pace of business spending was little changed in the Chicago District. Meanwhile, demand in the service sector generally strengthened in St. Louis and Kansas City. Staffing agencies in the Richmond District reported somewhat weaker demand overall, while staffing agencies in the Chicago and Dallas Districts said that demand was stable. In transportation services, intermodal shipments edged down in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, while freight service growth was flat in the Cleveland District. Reports on air travel remained strong despite route reductions, according to contacts in the Kansas City Districts. 
In service sector labor markets, Chicago reported a slower pace of hiring in recent weeks and Minneapolis reported that employment in professional services companies decreased from a year ago and is expected to remain flat over the next year. Cleveland and Richmond reported little net change in services employment, while contacts in the St. Louis District said that expansion at firms in some services industries will lead to additional hiring. Boston and Dallas noted tight labor markets for some skilled workers. 
Manufacturing. Manufacturing activity was generally soft since the last report. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago reported that activity had weakened, 
iv 
although St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated that activity had increased slightly. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco described factory activity as nearly steady. Reports of softer demand for housing-related products continued to be widespread. Many Districts cited higher production costs and cuts in employment that contacts attributed to slumping home sales and construction. The Atlanta and Chicago Districts indicated that automotive production or sales fell short of expectations, while the Cleveland District saw an uptick in the production of domestic nameplates. Reports on food processing were mixed with some Districts indicating that higher prices had constrained demand, while others noted rising demand. 
Industries demonstrating increased activity were boosted, in part, by a strong overseas market. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas reported that the demand for steel was strong. The output of energy-related equipment increased in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts, while strong sales of farm equipment boosted demand for manufacturers of heavy equipment according to Chicago and San Francisco. Dallas also reported strong demand for transportation equipment to supply defense and aircraft industries. 
Real Estate and Construction. Residential real estate markets were generally weak across most of the nation. District reports indicated flat or declining home sales in Boston, New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Dallas, and contacts in Philadelphia did not expect housing activity to expand strongly this year. Contacts in San Francisco reported that housing markets remained exceptionally weak, although a few reports pointed to some recent pickup in home sales attributed to increased affordability. Scattered reports from Philadelphia and Kansas City indicated seasonal improvements. Inventory levels of 
v 
new and existing homes remained high or were rising in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco. Home sales prices decreased somewhat in Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco, but remained relatively stable in Richmond and Chicago. The New York and Chicago Districts noted that some potential buyers had difficulty in obtaining financing. Residential construction declined in Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, but was flat to slightly higher in parts of the Atlanta District and spiked in areas of the Dallas District where demand for apartments was solid. Homebuilders in Cleveland expected no improvement in the housing industry for the remainder of 2008, and Chicago reported that limited credit availability for new developments had caused many builders to suffer losses on existing projects. Richmond and San Francisco noted an increase in home foreclosures. 
Commercial real estate conditions varied in April and May, with some Districts reporting that activity had softened. Leasing activity eased in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. Minneapolis, however, reported that market activity was up modestly, while activity was mixed across the St. Louis District. Vacancy rates edged higher in Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco, as well as in pockets of the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Absorption was negative in Boston and in Minneapolis for both office and manufacturing space. Overall rents were on the rise in New York, but were stable or beginning to slip in Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City. Sales trended downward according to the New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City Districts. 
Reports on nonresidential construction activity were mixed. Contacts from Chicago and Minneapolis saw slight increases in activity. Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
vi 
Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas, however, reported easing or weak levels of construction. A number of Districts – Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas – reported that obtaining financing remained difficult for some projects. 
Banking and Finance. Reports on lending activity varied across Districts, although reports of softening in the consumer segment persisted. Overall loan demand cooled in Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco, while Philadelphia and Cleveland saw a modest increase. New York reported little change in demand across all categories, while lending activity in Chicago was mixed. Residential lending activity remained generally weak in Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago. In contrast, demand picked up in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas, but was about the same in St. Louis. Commercial and industrial lending activity was mostly unchanged or declining in New York, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, while Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago saw slight increases. Atlanta reported commercial lending activity as mixed. 
The New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts reported increases in overall delinquencies, with respondents in New York indicating a notable rise in late payments for consumer loans. Credit quality deteriorated further in San Francisco, but began to stabilize in Chicago and Dallas. Contacts in Kansas City and Dallas expected loan quality to deteriorate going forward. All Districts reporting on credit standards noted further tightening for consumer, residential, and commercial loans. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Despite less-than-ideal weather, crop conditions generally improved for most reporting Districts. Reports from the Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts indicated that the combination of cooler- than-normal weather and wet conditions delayed planting and development of many 
vii 
crops. St. Louis said that planting of major crops was behind its five-year average pace, while Minneapolis noted delayed planting and development of corn and soybeans. Richmond and Chicago reported that some crops would require replanting, although Chicago District contacts expected small losses in yields. Despite weather delays, Kansas City noted that corn planting was almost complete, soybean planting was in progress, and the winter wheat crop was in good condition. Chicago and Dallas cited high input costs and price movements for corn as factors leading farmers to shift production away from corn towards soybeans. Dairy and livestock producers in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts voiced concerns that rising feed costs were eating into profit margins. 
Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Cleveland said that energy producers reported a pickup in oil and gas drilling, and Minneapolis indicated that robust oil and gas exploration and production continued in their District. Kansas City noted that the number of active drilling rigs surged since the last survey period and remained well above year-ago levels. San Francisco reported that oil and natural gas extraction expanded further in response to growing demand, but that activity had been constrained slightly by a shortage of equipment and materials. In contrast, Dallas noted that high oil and natural gas prices had pushed drilling to the highest level in 20 years without any shortages of equipment and services to date. 
Prices and Wages. Business contacts in most Districts reported increases in input prices since the last report, especially prices for energy, petroleum derivatives, metals, plastics, chemicals, and food. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts 
viii 
reported some ability to pass along the higher costs to customers and contacts in the Cleveland District noted that they are considering additional price increases in the near future if input costs continue to rise. On the other hand, contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts noted falling or stable prices for certain goods related to the construction industry. Retail price reports were mixed, with contacts in the San Francisco District reporting subdued price pressures for most products save food and energy-intensive goods. Contacts in the New York District reported steady retail prices with somewhat more aggressive discounting. However, retail contacts in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts reported higher prices, while retailers in the Chicago District reported increased pressure to pass along higher food and energy prices. Contacts in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts cited expectations for higher retail prices in the near future. 
Business contacts in most Districts reported moderate or limited wage growth in response to some loosening of labor market conditions. Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted wage pressures for certain skilled labor positions in industries facing worker shortages.",0,0
2008-05-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic conditions have weakened since the last report. Nine Districts noted slowing in the pace of economic activity, while the remaining three—Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond—described activity as mixed or steady. 
Consumer spending was characterized as softening across most of the country, with some Districts reporting year-over-year declines in retail and/or auto sales. In contrast, tourism was generally described as strong, with a number of Districts noting particular strength in foreign visitors. Reports on nonfinancial services varied by District: demand for transportation services was generally characterized as weak, while business and health services continued to expand; other service industries were said to be mixed. Trends in manufacturing also varied across Districts. Reports on real estate and construction were generally anemic for the residential sector; activity in the commercial sector has slowed. Financial institutions in many Districts indicated some deceleration in consumer loan demand, tightening in lending standards, and deterioration in asset quality. Most Districts reported improved conditions in the agricultural sector and robust activity in the energy industry. 
Labor markets were mostly described as weakening since the last report, though a few Districts reported ongoing shortages of skilled workers and some Districts noted wage pressures. Increases in input costs were widespread, accompanied by somewhat smaller rises in selling prices.

ii 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Consumer spending weakened in most, but not all, Districts since the last report. In particular, automobile sales were generally reported to be flat or declining. Vehicle sales were described as unchanged or falling in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts and were characterized as weak in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. However, Kansas City reported that auto sales rebounded in March, though they remained lower than a year earlier. Non-auto retailers reported that sales were sluggish or declining in ten Districts. Elsewhere, Boston noted mixed sales trends, and New York reported a modest pickup since the last report. Chicago, San Francisco, and, to a lesser extent, Philadelphia noted relative strength in demand for luxury goods. 
Retail inventories were generally reported to be steady or rising. Automobile inventories were said to be accumulating in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts. Among non-auto retailers, despite weakness in sales, only a few reported any notable inventory accumulation; Atlanta cited some increase in inventories, while the Richmond and San Francisco Districts noted that some inventory accumulation has prompted retailers to cancel orders. 
Despite the general weakness in consumer spending, tourism was generally described as robust, with that strength, in a number of instances, attributed to international visitors. The Boston, New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts reported strong tourism activity, while the Richmond and Chicago Districts described that sector as mixed, with pockets of strength. San Francisco indicated mixed but generally weak tourism activity. Reports from Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis specifically cited foreign visitors as a source of strength. 
iii 
Nonfinancial Services 
Activity in the service sector was mixed across Districts and across industries since the last report. Looking at the service sector in broad terms, Boston, Richmond, and Minneapolis reported some revenue growth; New York and St. Louis noted some softening; and San Francisco saw some deceleration. A number of Districts reported weakness in transportation services: New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas described shipping and freight activity as sluggish or weakening, with New York attributing the softening to declining import volume at the port. Richmond ports also noted weakening in imports but robust export activity. There were scattered reports of continued expansion in some other service industries, such as business services (Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis) and health care (Chicago, San Francisco). Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity was varied, with some Districts reporting a slight increase in activity, some indicating weaker activity, and several noting that activity was mixed or had held steady. Chicago, Boston, and Richmond reported that activity was rising, but not substantially, while New York, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Dallas all reported that activity had weakened. St. Louis and Cleveland said that activity had held steady, while Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco saw activity as mixed. 
Demand was reported as strong for aerospace, aircraft, and defense goods, as well as for steel and food. Automakers increased production modestly in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, but vehicle production declined in the Atlanta district. The Philadelphia District found that that demand for metals and machinery had increased. Many Districts cited strong exports generally. Most Districts saw a continued slide in the demand for goods related to 
iv 
residential construction. Excess capacity led to production declines in the high-tech industry in the Dallas District, and Chicago reported weak demand for heavy equipment. Uncertainty about economic conditions is leading to a varied, but generally subdued, outlook for manufacturers. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Housing markets and home construction remained sluggish throughout most of the nation, though there were few signs of any quickening in the pace of deterioration. Ongoing weakness in housing markets, in general, was reported in almost all Districts. Sales activity was generally reported to be declining in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, while Kansas City and Chicago noted slack demand and excess inventories. On the other hand, the Cleveland District saw some pickup in activity, while Richmond and Atlanta reported some pockets of improvement; Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago cited some recent pickup in traffic or buyer inquiries. New residential construction was reported to have remained at depressed levels, and none of the Districts reported any pickup since the last report. 
Declines or downward pressures in selling prices were specifically reported in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. In particular, New York and San Francisco noted some incipient price declines in areas that had previously shown resilience—respectively, New York City and the Pacific Northwest, as well as Utah. On the other hand, the Cleveland District noted some stabilization in home prices. 
Commercial real estate markets were generally reported to be steady or softening in most areas. Weaker conditions in the rental market were reported in eight Districts: New 
v 
York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. On the other hand, the leasing market was found to be steady in Boston, Kansas City and Dallas. Reports on commercial development were mixed with activity having weakened in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, but having increased in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. St. Louis characterized commercial construction as strong. However, sales of commercial properties were generally indicated to be sluggish, while prices were said to be under downward pressure. The Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported weakness in commercial real estate sales and prices. 
Banking and Finance 
Banks reported mixed trends in lending activity, with fairly widespread slowing in the consumer segment but some stabilization, at low levels, in residential mortgage activity. Overall lending activity was reported to have increased in the Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis Districts, but to have declined in the New York, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Dallas described lending activity as steady but soft. Lending activity for new home mortgages, though generally characterized as sluggish, was reported to have stabilized in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Consumer loan demand, however, weakened in a number of Districts: New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City. 
Credit quality was reported to have deteriorated, on balance, since the last report. Increased delinquency rates were noted by New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland, while Kansas City reported that loan quality remained lower than a year ago. Widespread tightening in credit standards was reported, especially on residential and commercial real

estate loans. In general, banks were reported to be tightening credit standards in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. In addition, Boston noted that standards remain tight on commercial mortgages, while Philadelphia indicated that banks are limiting lending in this category. Richmond indicated tighter standards on residential mortgages. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural reports were generally upbeat, with most respondents citing improved growing conditions and favorable pricing. Although drought conditions continued to persist in some areas of the Atlanta and Richmond Districts, soil moisture was adequate for spring planting, in part, due to increases in precipitation in March and early April. Reports from the Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts indicated that cool temperatures, dry conditions, or flooding toward the end of March damaged some winter crops and delayed field preparations for spring plantings. Farmers in the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts all reported plans to shift production away from corn toward soybeans in 2008, in part, because of favorable soybean prices and elevated corn production costs. Some farms in the San Francisco District expressed concern over prolonged drought conditions and pending cuts in water deliveries. Dairy and livestock producers in the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts expressed concern that increased feed costs had reduced margins. 
Districts reporting on energy continued to see robust levels of activity and steady to increasing prices. In the Dallas District, drilling remained strong and natural gas production has continued to increase. In the Minneapolis District, expansion of the mining industry was 
vii 
underway, while oil and gas exploration remained robust. In general, contacts contended that increased demand for energy was expected to continue to boost activity and prices. Labor Markets 
Despite some variation across Districts, employment levels appeared to be little changed, on balance, from recent months. Some weakening in the job market was reported in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts. Cleveland reported flat employment levels, while Richmond indicated mixed trends. Boston and Kansas City indicated modest increases in employment, with some deceleration indicated in the latter. Firms in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts reported layoffs, reductions in work hours, or hiring freezes in response to current or expected slowing in economic activity. 
Despite the general softening in their markets overall, Atlanta and Chicago noted scattered shortages of skilled workers in various service industries. Dallas reported relatively tight labor market conditions overall and cited shortages of managers and engineers, as well as farm workers. Staffing and temp agencies reported mixed trends in labor demand: New York, Richmond, and Chicago reported some softening, whereas Cleveland and Dallas note some pickup. In the financial services industry, some weakening in employment trends was reported in the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Districts, and San Francisco noted job losses in firms servicing the real estate industry. Prices 
Business contacts across all Districts continued to report increases in input costs and output prices. In particular, price increases were consistently reported for food products, fuel and energy products, and many raw materials. More specifically, increases in the price of chemicals, metals, plastics and other petroleum-based products were commonly cited. Most 
viii 
manufacturers have or are planning to increase prices in response to rising input costs, while the response of service firms has been more mixed, in part due to differences in competitive pressures. On balance, input costs have risen more rapidly than output prices, putting pressure on margins for many firms. Most Districts reported little change in retail price inflation, though Richmond and San Francisco noted some moderation. 
Most business contacts reported that wages were unchanged or were increasing moderately in all Districts. Business contacts in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts indicated that there has been some upward wage pressure for skilled labor in some sectors that continue to experience shortages.",1,1
2008-04-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic growth has slowed since 
the beginning of the year. Two-thirds of the Districts cited softening or weakening in the pace of business activity, while the others referred to subdued, slow, or modest growth. Retail activity in most Districts was reported to be weak or softening, although tourism generally continued to expand. Services industries in many Districts, including staffing services in Boston, port activity in New York, and truck freight volume in Cleveland, appeared to be slowing, but activity in services provided some positive news in Richmond and Dallas. Manufacturing was said to be sluggish or to have slowed in about half the Districts, while several others indicated manufacturing results were mixed or trends were steady. 
Residential real estate markets generally remained weak; reports on commercial real estate markets were somewhat mixed, but also suggest slowing, on balance, in many Districts. Most Districts reporting on banking cite tight or tightening credit standards and stable or weaker loan demand. Districts reporting on the agriculture and energy sectors said activity is generally strong. 
Upward pressure on prices from rising materials and energy prices was noted in almost all the District reports, but Philadelphia said increases in input costs and output prices had recently become less prevalent, and San Francisco indicated pressures were limited for products other than food and energy. By contrast, wage and salary pressures were generally said to be modest, as the hiring pace slowed in various sectors and labor markets loosened somewhat in many Districts. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Reports on retail spending were generally downbeat, although Boston, St. Louis, and Dallas described sales as mixed and Kansas City reported that consumer spending was “largely unchanged” since the previous survey period. The majority of Districts characterized sales as below plan, downbeat, weak, or having softened. Among product categories, apparel sales were soft in New York, Philadelphia,

i 
and Richmond, but strong in Boston. Several Districts noted declines in sales of big-ticket and/or home- related items. 
Districts commenting on vehicle sales described them as slow or sluggish, with little exception. Contacts in Dallas attributed an uptick in auto sales to increased advertising and incentives. Chicago dealerships reported some increases in used car sales in February. Dealers in the Philadelphia District expected sales to increase later in the year, but Cleveland did not expect significant change in the upcoming months. 
The majority of reports on tourism were positive, on balance, although most Districts mentioned some areas of softening. The San Francisco District commented that while tourism in Hawaii had fallen from previous levels, activity in California remained stable, partly because of growing foreign travel resulting from the lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar. Minneapolis reported an increase in tourism activity generally relating to winter sports. Tourism and travel in Kansas City, Atlanta, New York, and Chicago were also mostly positive. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Reports from nonfinancial services industries were mixed. Health-care services expanded in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, while contacts in the St. Louis District reported a softening and plans to lay off workers. Software and IT services respondents in Boston reported modest growth. 
Available reports from staffing firms pointed to mixed demand for temporary labor. The Boston, New York, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts reported weaker staffing requests relative to a year ago; Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas reported stable to increased demand. Boston noted increased demand from the biopharmaceutical and aerospace industries, while Dallas contacts saw an increased demand for temporary workers in IT, engineering, and oil-related services. A large New York employment agency found that despite widely announced layoff plans at financial firms, they saw no noticeable increase in the number of job candidates. Boston and Atlanta noted improved labor supply. 
ii 
All Districts reporting on transportation services noted weaker activity in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the previous quarter. Trucking and shipping respondents from the Richmond and Dallas Districts reported declining import volumes, which more than offset growth in exports, stimulated by the depreciation of the dollar. However, airlines in those Districts in reported higher passenger volumes since the start of the year. 
Manufacturing 
Reports on the manufacturing sector were mixed but, on the whole, subdued. New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated that production or shipments were sluggish or falling. Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco characterized activity as varying across industries. Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago indicated stable levels or trends. Only St. Louis noted a strengthening relative to prior reports. 
Various Districts cited strong demand for steel, aircraft and parts, energy-related equipment, and exports, but mostly continued weak markets for products and equipment used for building and furnishing homes. Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas indicated that automotive production and sales have been light or declining. On the other hand, the Cleveland District saw an uptick in the production of foreign nameplates during January, and St. Louis was anticipating additional capacity and employment in automotive parts manufacturing. Dallas reported that refining production fell in the face of weak margins. Reports on food processing were mixed, with some Districts indicating that high prices were constraining demand, while others cited rising demand. Boston and New York mentioned that some manufacturers are experiencing slower payments from their customers. 
All Districts commenting on the near-term outlook mentioned caution or concern on the part of at least some segments of manufacturing. Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated that some firms are adjusting their hiring or capital spending plans downward. A couple of Districts mentioned risks associated with financing constraints. For example, Chicago cited concerns on the part 
iii 
of the auto industry that tight credit would cause its customers to become more price-sensitive and less able to obtain car loans. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate markets were generally weak over the last couple of months. Sales were low in every District with very few local exceptions. Sales declines were particularly large in the Boston, Minneapolis, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts; at least some respondents in each of these Districts reported drops in home sales of more than 20 percent year-over-year. Contacts in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Philadelphia Districts cited tight credit conditions as a reason for low sales; each of those Districts either reported or expected stabilization of demand for homes in the low and mid-price ranges. 
Districts that reported home prices all saw overall declines; one exception was the Manhattan co- op and condo market, where prices increased 5 percent compared with a year ago. Inventories remained high as demand was still fairly low. A few contacts in the Chicago, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts reported an increase in inquiries, although this increase in traffic had not yet translated into increased sales. Residential construction declined or remained at low levels in most Districts. 
The markets for office and retail space showed signs of a slowdown in several Districts. Office vacancies were reported up, and leasing volumes down, in Manhattan, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Memphis, portions of Maine and Rhode Island, and Las Vegas. Districts indicated that office vacancies held steady in Boston and the Carolinas, and were down in Philadelphia and in the Minneapolis and St. Louis Districts; however, contacts in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts and see some emerging slack. Office rents were mixed, however, coming in about flat in greater Boston and Manhattan, either flat or down in the Richmond District, and up in Philadelphia. Retail vacancy was reported up in the Minneapolis District and retail space demand was described as slow in the Chicago District. Demand for industrial space was described as either “firm” or “flat” in the Districts commenting on that sector. 
Sales activity in nonresidential markets was down in the Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, and Chicago Districts, with contacts citing tight credit conditions as a major factor. Office sales activity 
iv 
remained strong, however, in the major cities of the New York District and in the San Francisco District. Eight of the twelve Districts reported that nonresidential construction activity was slow; countering these reports, the Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts indicated that construction remained strong. 
Banking and Finance 
Reports on loan demand for commercial, industrial, and residential mortgage loans varied across Districts. Overall loan demand was flat in San Francisco and weakened in the Kansas City, St. Louis, Dallas, New York, and Richmond Districts. Consumer lending was flat or declining in the St. Louis, Chicago, and Cleveland Districts. Commercial and industrial loan demand was mixed in San Francisco and remained stable or declined in the Kansas City, St. Louis, Dallas, New York, and Richmond Districts. By contrast, the Chicago and Cleveland Districts reported increased business lending. Even as loan demand for new residential mortgages remained sluggish or declined, lower interest rates prompted increases in refinancing of existing mortgages in a number of Districts, including San Francisco, St. Louis, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Cleveland, and Chicago. Cleveland cited a small rise in delinquencies, especially for real estate loans, and Atlanta reported an increase in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures. New York, on the other hand, saw a rise in delinquencies for all loan categories except residential mortgages, which were unchanged. Tight credit standards were reported in the Atlanta, San Francisco, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, Dallas, Richmond, and New York Districts. Kansas City indicated a worsening of overall loan quality, Chicago reported a deterioration of consumer loan quality, and Cleveland also saw a decline in credit quality for business customers and consumers. By contrast, Dallas reported sound credit quality. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
The Chicago, San Francisco, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts reported strong conditions in the agriculture sector, including high prices for winter wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum, and hogs, and increased production of some crops. By contrast, Atlanta and Richmond indicated that although recent rain had improved conditions in Maryland and Virginia, drought conditions persisted in 
v 
other areas, and range pasture conditions remained poor. Farm incomes and/or value of production rose in several Districts during 2007, although Kentucky farmers saw no change and Tennessee farmers saw declines compared to 2006. Increases in input costs, including prices of fuel, fertilizer, and feed were mentioned by Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco as potentially affecting future production and incomes; Chicago and Dallas also cited recent weather-related problems that threaten production this spring. Increases in the value of farmland were reported by Chicago and Minneapolis. 
All Districts reporting on energy cited robust levels of activity and steady or higher prices; in addition, Kansas City and Cleveland mentioned increases in hiring. However, Dallas noted that drilling had flattened domestically and declined in the Gulf of Mexico, leaving activity outside of North America to drive future growth, while Kansas City, Cleveland, and Minneapolis expected exploration and capital spending to increase going forward. Rates for durable equipment, and drilling and evaluation services were reported to be flat to declining. However, price pressures, regulatory costs, and tightening credit were mentioned as providing possible future impediments to increased production. 
Prices and Wages 
Business contacts in many Districts cited price pressures from vendors and mixed success in raising their own prices to recoup the increased costs. Manufacturing contacts in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts pointed to rising costs for raw materials or other inputs, while manufacturing firms in the New York District reported more widespread increases in prices paid “than in well over a year.” By contrast, Philadelphia noted somewhat less prevalent increases in input costs and output prices in February than in January, except for increased mention of rising prices for imported goods. Upward pressures on input costs from high or rising energy prices were frequently cited, which also translated into increased transportation and shipping costs. Price increases for metals, petrochemicals, and food were also mentioned often. The San Francisco District, however, indicated that price pressures were limited except for food and energy. Firms’ ability to pass along cost increases by raising selling prices varied. The Boston District noted that retail contacts were 
vi 
passing some price increases on to customers, and some manufacturers were raising selling prices to partially offset rising costs; half the manufacturers contacted in the Cleveland District had raised prices or added surcharges since the previous report. The Dallas and Atlanta Districts reported that some firms raised prices but others were constrained by competitive pressures; Chicago indicated that contacts outside of construction and retail were passing cost increases along to customers. In the Kansas City District, factory goods’ prices had escalated, but retail prices were mostly stable. 
Most Districts indicated that contacted businesses reported limited wage pressures, moderate wage increases, and some loosening of labor markets. While Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco noted short supplies of selected types of skilled labor relative to demand, they and the New York, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts cited pullbacks in the pace of hiring by some firms. Furthermore, several Districts, including New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Atlanta, reported increased prevalence of layoffs, reductions in work hours, or hiring freezes.",1,1
2008-02-29,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity increased modestly during the survey period of mid-November through December, but at a slower pace compared with the previous survey period. Among Districts, seven reported a slight increase in activity, two reported mixed conditions, and activity in three Districts was described as slowing.
Most reports on retail activity indicated subdued holiday spending and further weakness in auto sales. However, most reports on tourism spending were positive. Residential real estate conditions continued to be quite weak in all Districts. Reports on commercial real estate activity varied, with some reports noting signs of softening demand. Manufacturing reports varied across industries, with pronounced weakness noted in housing-related industries as well as the automobile industry. Strong export orders and increased demand in industries whose products compete against imports was reported by some Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services remained generally positive, although some Districts commented on continuing weak demand for transportation services.
Reports from banks and other financial institutions noted further declines in residential real estate lending, and lending to the commercial real estate sector was generally described as mixed. Some Districts reported lower consumer loan volumes, whereas the volume of commercial and industrial lending varied. Most Districts cited tighter credit standards.
Demand continued to decline for construction workers and those in housing-related industries, according to most reports, while demand generally held steady for skilled workers in nonfinancial service industries. Wage increases remained moderate overall. Increases in prices for food, petrochemicals, metals, and energy-related inputs continued to be widely reported, and production and delivery costs for many products increased because of higher fuel prices. Producers in the agricultural sector reported generally strong demand and favorable production conditions outside of the drought-stricken areas in the Southeast. Strong oil and gas exploration and production activity was noted by several Districts.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Reports indicate that holiday sales were generally disappointing. Sales in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts were varyingly described as lackluster, weak, below year-ago levels, or mixed. Kansas City reported that spending was solid, but below expectations. Sales rose modestly according to Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and St. Louis reports. Atlanta and New York merchants noted that foreign buyers were a boost to holiday sales. Overall, the outlook for 2008 among retail merchants was cautious.
Most Districts reported that vehicle sales for late 2007 were below year-ago levels. However, the Minneapolis report noted strong demand from area farmers and Canadians purchasing vehicles across the border. The Atlanta and Kansas City Districts reported that sluggish vehicle demand has resulted in unexpected inventory accumulation. However, imports and fuel-efficient vehicles continued to sell well according to the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas reports. Atlanta noted that some foreign brands had turned to fleet sales to offset generally weaker retail demand. Dealers in Philadelphia and Cleveland anticipated that sales in 2008 would be flat to lower than in 2007.
Reports on tourism were mostly positive. The Atlanta District observed that Florida businesses catering to winter visitors experienced increased demand. The number of visitors from Europe and Canada were especially strong, and bookings for the Spring were robust. Minneapolis reported that solid snowfall in many parts of the District helped spur winter tourism activity. Richmond’s assessment of tourist activity was also generally upbeat. Tourism activity in New York City was said to have remained strong through year-end.
Nonfinancial Services 
Most reports cited robust demand in several nonfinancial service industries including health care, hospitality, legal, and insurance. According to Atlanta, the demand for engineers, particularly in petrochemical fields, was very strong. Reports on temporary staffing services were mixed. For instance, Dallas and Philadelphia noted that employment firms reported weaker demand for temporary workers, whereas New York and Richmond reported relatively strong demand.
Demand for transportation services was generally weak, led by lower demand from the housing sector. Reports indicated that freight volume continued to weaken in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts and was slow overall in the Dallas District. Inter-modal transportation volumes were also said to be lower in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, although Dallas noted that rail shipments were up, led by strong agricultural shipments.
Manufacturing
Reports on manufacturing activity varied. Kansas City reported that manufacturing was expanding and that manufacturers were relatively upbeat. Cleveland reported that manufacturing output remained steady overall, whereas Dallas indicated that conditions continued to soften. New York reported that manufacturing activity appeared to weaken somewhat in early December, but noted some improvement later in the month. Among the positive reports, San Francisco noted that production and new orders for commercial aircraft and parts remained solid, while sales of information-technology products continued to increase moderately. Boston said that sales of aircraft equipment and pharmaceuticals continued to rise at a robust rate. Atlanta and Minneapolis noted that defense and energy-related manufacturers reported strong activity. St. Louis and San Francisco reported that the local food production industry was expanding.
Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Atlanta reported that many firms were expanding export activity. In some cases, demand was also said to have increased as a result of import substitution. For example, Chicago reported that domestic steel production was expanding, led by a moderation in imports. Demand for equipment used in energy extraction and mining continued to be robust as well.
However, according to most Districts, conditions in manufacturing industries producing construction and home-related goods remained weak. Richmond noted weakness in demand for electronics, and San Francisco described production of industrial equipment as tepid. In addition, auto-related production was soft according to the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis reports.
Real Estate and Construction 
Conditions in most housing markets remained quite weak through year-end. The pace of sales continued to be sluggish, and inventories persisted at historically high levels according to most Districts. Home construction levels continued to decline according to Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and St. Louis reports. Reports on home prices varied. While Dallas observed that home prices were steady, Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and Richmond reported that prices declined; the Boston and San Francisco Districts said that changes in home prices were mixed. Overall, contacts anticipate that housing markets will remain weak during the first part of 2008.
Reports on commercial real estate activity varied, with some Districts noting that activity had eased late in the year. Contacts in the Atlanta and Boston Districts indicated that commercial markets were little changed while the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Richmond reports suggested slower growth. Activity was stable to increasing according to the Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco reports. Vacancy rates were described as stable in the New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City Districts, and as varied in the Richmond District. Chicago and Minneapolis contacts noted that retail vacancies had risen. Kansas City contacts reported that leasing activity was stable, whereas leasing activity in the Richmond, Philadelphia, and New York Districts had slowed. Most Boston District contacts reported that rents were flat, while rents were steady to declining according to the Chicago and Kansas City reports. New York and Richmond noted that rental rates had stabilized in the fourth quarter, whereas Dallas continued to report rising rental rates.
Contacts in the Boston and Chicago Districts indicated that commercial construction activity was slowing. Developers in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts reported smaller backlogs of projects while Cleveland District contacts said that backlogs had risen. Most contacts anticipate a slower pace of commercial development during 2008.
Banking and Finance
Reports suggest that both business and consumer lending activity slowed in most Districts from mid-November through December. Residential mortgage lending continued to contract in all Districts while refinancing activity varied. For instance, Chicago and Richmond noted increased refinancing activity, but New York cited widespread declines in refinancing. Reports on commercial real estate loan demand were also mixed, although Dallas and Cleveland noted relatively healthy demand. Most reports indicated that credit standards for most loan categories had tightened over the period. Downward pressure on deposits was noted by Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, St Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Several Districts reported declines in loan quality and increased delinquencies.
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
The performance of the agricultural sector across Districts was generally favorable. Upbeat conditions in Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco were attributed to a combination of higher crop prices and favorable weather. Dallas and San Francisco reported strong domestic and global demand for their products. Kansas City reported that strong demand and low inventories boosted prices and income for crop producers. However, despite recent rains, conditions for drought-stricken areas in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts remained generally poor.
Activity in the energy sector increased according to the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. Dallas noted a sharp rise in the Texas rig count while Kansas City cited strong drilling activity in Oklahoma and Colorado. However, seasonal factors dampened drilling activity in the Cleveland District, and reports on coal production in the region were mixed. Atlanta indicated that Gulf Coast crude inventories were low, but new offshore platforms should help boost production in 2008.
Prices and Wages
According to most reports, businesses continued to face rising costs for food, petrochemicals, metals, and energy-related inputs. Several Districts noted that transportation costs for most products increased. Philadelphia reported that some firms had raised output prices in order to cover higher energy costs. In the San Francisco District, price inflation was said to be limited in general, but significant for food and energy. Dallas reported that high or rising input costs were squeezing margins for most industries. Manufacturers in the New York District reported prices paid and received had increased and that this was expected to continue. Atlanta noted that input costs continued to increase for imported goods originating in Europe or Japan because of the lower value of the dollar. In contrast, producers of framing lumber, wallboard, and wood panels reported weak prices according to the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Chicago reports.
Reports suggest that labor markets remained relatively tight overall, and especially for skilled workers, whereas housing-related industries continued to trim payrolls. Increases in employment costs were generally described as moderate. Kansas City reported that overall wage pressures eased, with only the energy sector citing significant wage pressure. Philadelphia reported that labor costs continued to increase at a moderate pace while Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that wage pressures remained limited outside of a few sectors that continue to experience shortages of skilled labor. Wage pressures were not significant according to the Cleveland report.",0,1
2007-11-30,"Anecdotal reports from the Federal Reserve Banks suggest economic activity continued to expand in all Districts in September and early October but the pace of growth decelerated since August. Growth was similar to that observed in the last Beige Book in seven Districts--Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis. The economy grew at a slower rate in five Districts--Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Richmond and San Francisco. The expansion was variously characterized as ""moderate,"" ""modest"" and ""mixed.""
Consumer spending expanded, but reports were uneven and suggest growth was slower in September and early October than in August. The manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, but growth weakened--mostly for products and services related to home construction and real estate transactions. Several manufacturing and service firms reported that weaker domestic demand was offset by strong sales to global markets.
Residential real estate markets continued to weaken, and most Districts reported additional declines in home sales, prices and construction. Financial institutions reported an increase in delinquencies and slight deterioration in credit quality. Lenders in many Districts tightened credit standards, particularly for real estate. The majority of reports indicated an increase in business lending but a decline or slower growth in consumer lending.
Activity in the energy industry is still robust but growth has slowed. Favorable agricultural conditions are contributing to a bumper crop throughout much of the country, but drought continues to hamper production in the southeast.
Contacts in a number of industries indicated a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty about the outlook for economic activity. Many real estate contacts expect housing markets to remain subdued for several months. At firms without direct ties to real estate and construction, contacts are still wary that credit tightening and slowing construction might slow activity in their industry, but there is cautious optimism because few see much evidence of such spillovers at this time.
Job growth eased in some regions, but labor shortages were reported for many occupations in most Districts and are said to be restraining economic activity in some instances. Wages rose moderately except for workers in short supply, where sharp increases were reported for some positions. Upward pressure on input costs are reported in most Districts, but competitive pressures are restraining the ability to pass higher input costs to selling prices in many instances.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Retail sales increased, but reports were uneven and suggest growth has softened. Sales were weak at department and discount stores and for furniture and other home durables. Purchases of electronics and luxury items remained solid. Unseasonably mild weather dampened apparel sales in some regions.
There appeared to be a high level of uncertainty about the outlook for retail sales, and a few Districts report that retailers have reduced inventories. Vehicle sales were weaker, but reports indicated that sales of fuel-efficient and used cars remained strong. Tourist activity was generally solid.
Manufacturing
Factory activity continued to expand, but reports suggested that growth has been dampened by declining output of products used in home construction. A few Districts noted that export demand for other products helped sustain growth. District reports indicated strong growth of sales for paper, steel, machine tools, agricultural machinery, energy equipment, electrical equipment, defense and aerospace, chemicals and health-related equipment.
The outlook for factory activity is uneven. Boston District contacts noted continued weakness in housing and possible negative spillovers from tight credit but point to export growth and new product development as sources of strength. Manufacturers in the Cleveland District anticipate production remaining at current levels or decreasing slightly. Factories in the Kansas City District cut inventory levels and expect further reductions. Automakers in the Chicago District anticipate weakness in auto sales, but the St. Louis District reports major hiring to support the opening of new facilities for motor vehicle parts manufacturing.
Services
Districts reporting on business services indicated the sector is in expansion but the strength varied. Temporary staffing firms reported increased hiring, with the exception of activity to support financial services and real estate. Shipping activity was mixed and suggests some softening. Container shipments and regional freight activity were softer in the Atlanta and New York Districts, but freight hauling and shipping firms in the Dallas District reported increases in volume. Dallas District airlines say traffic is steady and bookings are solid.
Construction and Real Estate
Home sales continued to fall or increased more slowly in most Districts. In some instances, buyers could no longer secure financing or were unable to sell their current homes. New home inventories remained elevated, and builders continued to curb new home construction. Rising inventories of existing homes added to uncertainty about the overall health of the housing market.
Commercial market fundamentals remained solid. Most Districts reported steady absorption of commercial space. Rental rates were firm to rising across Districts, with sizable increases for Manhattan office space. Construction activity continued at a steady pace overall. Some softness in commercial investment activity was noted, however, and several Districts reported a move to more conservative financing. Reports suggested developers are becoming more cautious--in some cases shelving or canceling projects.
Banking and Finance
District reports indicated increased delinquencies and a slight deterioration in credit quality. Lenders in many Districts tightened credit standards, including for consumers and all types of real estate. Consumer lending grew more slowly in most Districts. Lending for home mortgages, equity lines and refinancing continued to soften or decline in most Districts, which some reports attributed to tighter lending standards. Overall business lending was up, but tightening lending standards were applied, particularly for real estate.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Favorable agricultural conditions in much of the country have allowed harvests to run ahead of normal schedules and contributed to above-average crop yields throughout much of the country. A near-record corn crop and above-average soybean yields are expected. Livestock producers reported strong demand and high prices.
Bumper crops have strained storage capacity and caused transportation problems. The Chicago District notes that transportation and storage problems emerged because of the size and speed of the harvest and because cash prices are enough lower than futures prices that farmers have an incentive to store crops until 2008.
Crop production has been hampered by dry or drought conditions in Alabama, the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. Shortages of feed and low forage supplies have led some livestock producers in these areas to cull their herds. The Chicago District reports that crop yields in Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin were less affected by a summertime drought than had been anticipated by some observers.
Energy activity held at robust levels, and oil production was up slightly. While natural gas drilling activity is still vigorous, there were reports that high costs have or will lead to reductions in production. The Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts reported that overall mining activity was strong and expanding, with mines in the Minneapolis District producing near capacity.
Labor Markets
Labor markets remain tight across much of the country, and there continues to be moderate upward pressure on wages and benefits. Job growth eased in some regions, however, and wage pressures softened.
Most Districts report worker shortages in a variety of occupations, with sizable wage increases for workers in short supply. Positions mentioned as difficult to fill include scientific, technical, accounting, finance, engineering, marketing, health-care, truckers, welders, ironworkers, crane operators, office workers and energy-service workers. Low-skilled and entry-level workers are in short supply in some areas, including those in the retail and hospitality industries.
Prices
Upward pressure on input costs was reported by most Districts. Pushed up by strong domestic and international demand, energy and raw material costs are characterized as high by several Districts. Prices are up for a broad range of foods, including milk, corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, chicken and vegetables. Declines in the value of the dollar and high shipping costs have made imported goods more expensive. Insurance costs have increased in the Atlanta District.
The ability to pass higher input costs to selling prices was mixed. Some manufacturers raised selling prices as a result of higher costs, such as for food products, chemicals, machinery and oil and gas equipment. But there were also reports of lower prices, particularly for construction-related materials, such as lumber, wood, wallboard and some metals, pushing down construction costs. Competitive pressures are restraining retail price increases in many instances. Prices are higher for food products and at restaurants. Vehicle prices are lower, with dealers using incentive and discount programs or manufacturers adding features to vehicles without raising prices. Reports from the service sector suggest there have been continued increases in fees and fuel surcharges, but the rate of increase has not changed.",0,0
2007-10-31,"Reports from the Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity has continued to expand. St. Louis and Kansas City described the pace of activity as moderate; Cleveland, Chicago and Minneapolis said their economies were expanding at a modest rate; and Boston and Atlanta reported that activity was mixed. New York cited continued expansion. The economies in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco continued to grow; however, the pace of activity has slowed.
Most Banks reported that the recent developments in financial markets had led to tighter lending standards for residential mortgages, which was having a noticeable effect on housing activity, and several noted that the reduction in credit availability added to uncertainty about when the housing market might turn around. While several Banks noted that commercial real estate markets had also experienced somewhat tighter credit conditions, a number commented that credit availability and credit quality remained good for most consumer and business borrowers. Outside of real estate, reports that the turmoil in financial markets had affected economic activity during the survey period were limited.
Retail sales were generally positive, with increases characterized as modest to moderate. However, several Districts described motor vehicle and furniture sales as slow. Manufacturing activity expanded across most Districts, with reports of softening demand for building materials and autos. The weakness in the housing market deepened across most Districts, with sales weak or declining and prices reported to be falling or flat. Most Districts reported a continuing contraction in the residential mortgage market. Commercial real estate activity was generally stable to expanding. Demand for business loans held steady or weakened, while consumer lending was mixed. Agricultural conditions varied widely across Districts, with several reporting damage to crops and pastures as a result of excessive heat and drought conditions. Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained positive in all of the Districts reporting on these sectors. Nearly every District reported at least modest increases in employment during the recent survey period. Most Districts characterized their wage increases as moderate or steady. Wage pressures were intense only in isolated professions in short supply. And most Districts reported little change in overall price pressures.
Consumer Spending and Tourism Districts generally reported modest to moderate increases in sales, although Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco described retail sales as mixed. Dallas reported little change in consumer spending growth. Richmond reported that retail sales posted modest gains in July but pulled back sharply in August. New York, on the other hand, described July sales as somewhat below plan, but August sales as ahead of plan.
Furniture sales declined in Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco while Boston experienced stronger sales. Merchants in New York and Chicago reported a slight pickup in sales of home furnishings. Retailers in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City noted solid-to-strong back-to-school sales. However, Chicago and Dallas reported difficulty comparing back-to-school shopping with last year because of school-year timing. Boston and Kansas City reported strong sales of apparel items while New York and St. Louis experienced mixed results. Some weakening in apparel sales was seen in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago.
Vehicle sales were described as slow or subdued in many Districts. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, all reported sluggish new vehicle sales. In contrast, auto dealers reported that sales increased modestly in Kansas City and picked up slightly in Philadelphia. Cleveland and San Francisco noted strength in used vehicle sales. Many auto dealers reported anxiety about future sales due to tighter household credit conditions.
Districts that commented on retail inventory levels generally described them as at or above desired levels. Several retailers reported that they planned to or had already heavily discounted merchandise to move inventory.
Most reports on tourism were positive, with the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts reporting particularly solid growth in tourist spending. Minneapolis cited dry, warm weather for helping the tourism industry. Two Districts were less positive on tourism: San Francisco experienced slowing tourist activity and Chicago described a pessimistic outlook for the rest of the year despite a slight pickup in some parts of the District in August.
Services Reports on the service industry were generally neutral to positive. Several Districts posted strong gains in financial services, health care, information technology, and technical and professional services. Demand for legal services was stable or showed modest increases. Demand for transportation services showed signs of softening--Atlanta and Dallas reported decreased activity while Cleveland and Chicago cited no change. Reports from Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated that the recent volatility in financial markets may slow down the pace of business activity.
Manufacturing Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity expanded during late July and early August. New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated solid growth. Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis stated that manufacturing expanded but at a slower pace. Manufacturing was stable to increasing slightly in Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas, but was described as mixed in Boston and Atlanta.
The automobile and building materials industries showed weakness across most reporting Districts. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas all indicated that the auto sector had softened, though one report suggested that some of the reduction in production was related to model changeovers. Six Districts said that industries related to housing experienced weakness, including building materials and construction equipment.
Industries showing improved conditions varied markedly across Districts. High-technology manufacturing was strong in the Kansas City and San Francisco regions and showed steady growth in the Dallas District. A number of Districts reported steady to solid growth in aircraft and electrical equipment production and strength in exports. Chicago noted that some steel producers have started exporting steel regularly for the first time. Most Districts indicated that input price pressures held steady or rose modestly compared to the previous report. Expenditures for plant and equipment remained close to plan in Boston and Cleveland. Contacts in San Francisco reported that productivity improvements continued on trend in 2007. Looking forward, contacts in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City expressed near-term optimism about business conditions in their sectors; reports from Cleveland and Dallas were somewhat more cautious.
Real Estate and Construction
Residential real estate and construction weakened further in most Districts while the commercial market remained steady. Most Districts reported weak or declining residential sales and declining or stable prices. Markets in a few Districts did show some strength. Both sales and prices have been increasing in the Massachusetts housing market; the New York City apartment market remains tight as rents rise; and home sales rose in Louisville. Inventories of unsold homes are generally reported to be high. Moreover, contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas believe softness in the market will continue in the near future, with potential for further declines.
Commercial real estate and construction markets were generally stable to expanding across the Districts. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated continued expansion in nonresidential construction and commercial real estate. Dallas described the level of nonresidential activity as high, and St. Louis said commercial construction remained strong. New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City indicated commercial construction and real estate markets were steady or stable. Vacancy rates are reported to be low or declining in most Districts, and rents are rising modestly in many. Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas noted some tightening of credit in the commercial real estate market.
Banking and Finance The demand for residential mortgages continued a downward trend in most Districts. Consumer lending softened in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas, while St. Louis reported stable activity. In Philadelphia, personal loans increased on credit card lending. Looking forward, lenders in Dallas do not expect any further deterioration in consumer lending after the softening that was reported earlier in the year. Bankers in Philadelphia continue to see growth in personal lending over the next few quarters, albeit at a slower rate than in the first half of the year.
More than half of the Districts reported a tightening in credit standards. Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas mentioned tightening for both residential mortgages and business loans, while financial institutions in Atlanta and San Francisco said tighter standards were aimed primarily at home mortgage products. Delinquencies in consumer loans and mortgages rose slightly in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis, while New York reported no change in delinquencies across all loan categories.
Demand for business loans was steady or weakening in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis, while Philadelphia reported an increase in demand. Commercial real estate lending increased in Kansas City and was quite strong in San Francisco, where ""some banks reportedly are approaching regulatory limits on loan concentrations for this segment.""
Agriculture Agricultural conditions varied across Districts. High temperatures and drought conditions resulted in damage to crops and pastures in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. According to some estimates, the drought could cost Georgia and Florida farmers over $2 billion in lost production. Nevertheless, a report from Chicago indicated that even with unfavorable weather, the District was poised for a record corn harvest because farmers had planted more corn at the expense of soybeans. In the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, favorable summer rains boosted pasture growth and livestock conditions. Rains in the Kansas City District resulted in above-average wheat yields and improved growing conditions for corn and soybeans, which placed some downward pressure on crop prices. Further, livestock prices remained solid, although rising production costs trimmed margins for hog producers and cattle feedlot operators. In the San Francisco District, demand for agricultural products continued to grow, and supply conditions were largely favorable. Some agricultural contacts reported that pressures on input costs eased overall, but others noted that prices of feed grain increased further.
Natural Resources Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained positive as increases were observed in all Districts reporting on these developments. In Dallas, energy activity remained robust--domestic drilling has flattened out, while international drilling is growing and remained the primary source of strength for service companies. Kansas City reported stable drilling activity and expected increased activity heading forward. Cleveland's oil and gas producers reported production levels were flat to increasing slightly since mid-July. Both Cleveland and Kansas City cite the lack of qualified labor as a continuing strain on expansion. In the Minneapolis District, activity increased since the previous report, with mining production remaining at near capacity. The Atlanta District reported that Hurricane Dean did not have a significant impact on energy production along the Louisiana coast.
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices Nearly every District reported at least modest increases in employment during the recent survey period. The lone exception was Chicago, which, instead, characterized employment conditions as mixed. Philadelphia and San Francisco made no statement characterizing overall changes in District employment. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas described their labor markets as tight. Nine of the twelve Districts reported that there were shortages of some skilled workers, including those in the information technology, accountancy, legal, and health care professions. In addition, Kansas City noted shortages for workers with lower skills, such as housekeepers and waiters, while San Francisco reported that agricultural workers were in increasingly short supply. Staffing services firms reported more demand for temporary workers in several Districts (Boston, Richmond, and Dallas), but less demand in Cleveland. Several Districts reported declines in construction employment, though the San Francisco District reported that, in some areas, rising commercial construction has helped keep overall construction employment stable.
Though some Districts described employment condition as tight, most reported that wage increases were moderate or steady. Wage pressures were intense only in isolated professions in short supply. Several Districts also noted that costs of health care benefits continued to post large increases, although they were not accelerating.
Most Districts reported little change in overall price pressures. There was downward pressure on residential real estate prices across nearly all Districts. Three Districts--Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas--reported lower lumber prices, while Atlanta reported that these prices stabilized. Three Districts noted discounting among retailers during the back-to-school selling season (New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas), while two others reported overall declines in retailers' prices (Richmond and Kansas City). However, higher food costs continued to be widely reported and were said to be putting upward pressure on grocery and restaurant prices.",0,0
2007-08-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand in June and early July. New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco described the pace of growth as ""moderate"" while Cleveland and Chicago saw it as ""modest."" Philadelphia noted that economic conditions improved. Kansas City said the regional economy continued to grow but at a moderating pace, and Dallas characterized its economy as strong but said it decelerated. Boston and Atlanta described business contacts' reports as ""varied"" or ""mixed.""
On balance, consumer spending rose at a modest pace, although a number of Districts indicated that sales were mixed or below expectations. Several reports indicated that capital spending increased, and expenditures for most business services continued to rise. Employment increased further in most regions and in many sectors of the economy. Most Districts said that residential construction and real estate activity continued to decline. Commercial construction and real estate markets were generally more active than during the previous reporting period. District reports indicated that manufacturing activity continued to expand during June and early July. Household lending declined in most regions, while commercial and industrial lending expanded at a modest pace. Contacts generally reported ongoing input cost pressures, particularly for petroleum-related inputs, while prices at the retail level continued to increase at a moderate rate. Energy and natural resource activity remained at high levels, or in some instances, rose further. Many Districts described overall wage gains as moderate and/or similar to the previous reporting period. Agricultural conditions varied widely, as the impacts of drought were felt east of the Mississippi River and heavy rains affected the Dallas and Kansas City Districts.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
On balance, consumer spending rose at a modest pace, although a number of Districts indicated that sales were mixed or below expectations Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis all shared the general assessment that consumer spending rose modestly, while Philadelphia said retail sales growth was quite strong in May but ""closer to trend"" in June. New York, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported sales as flat and/or below expectations. The remaining regions described sales as mixed. A number of Districts noted that high gas prices restrained spending; Chicago also noted a negative impact from high food prices, and Dallas mentioned that wet weather depressed sales. Five regions indicated that retail sales of items related to housing--such as furniture and home repair materials--were weak or declining. Retail inventories were generally at desired levels across the country, while Atlanta and San Francisco observed some increases. New vehicle sales in many areas were described as ""flat"" or ""lackluster,"" although dealers in Philadelphia and Chicago noted some improvement between June and early July. Many Districts commented on the relative strength of demand for fuel-efficient vehicles compared with larger automobiles and of foreign brands compared to domestics.
The majority of reports on tourism were positive. Strong gains were noted in many sections of the New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis noted an increase in the number of Canadians visiting and shopping in the region, but Boston and San Francisco said that international tourism was down.
Business Spending and Hiring
Several reports indicated that capital spending increased. Firms in New York, Cleveland, and Chicago said capital outlays increased according to plans. Current investment was mixed in Boston; Kansas City said capital expenditures were trimmed slightly during the reporting period but were expected to rebound to prior levels in coming months. Philadelphia indicated that investment plans increased compared with two months earlier.
Reports on expenditures for most business services were generally positive. Several Districts noted strong gains by consulting, advertising, health care, scientific and technical, and telecommunications firms; demand for legal services was reported as mixed or unchanged by the Reserve Banks that commented on it. Philadelphia noted a significant increase in demand for business services from start-up and early-stage firms, and some contacts in the region expected further growth in overall service demand in the coming months. Demand for trucking firmed during recent weeks in Richmond and Dallas; reports in Cleveland ranged from strong growth to softening, while Atlanta and Chicago pointed to declines. Small-parcel shipping volumes were good in the Dallas region, and contacts there also expected a pickup in the future. Rail freight volumes declined in Cleveland and Dallas. Air travel was strong in Chicago and Dallas.
Employment continued to increase in most locations and in many sectors of the economy. Richmond said hiring ""intensified,"" Minneapolis indicated that labor markets tightened, and Atlanta and Dallas said labor markets remained tight. Kansas City said employment expanded at a slower pace than previously. Cleveland reported a slight increase in manufacturing employment over the past six weeks, and Richmond indicated that the weakness in factory payrolls in the region had moderated, while Boston said manufacturing employment was unchanged. Retail hiring was limited to store openings in the Cleveland District. Employment in several service-providing industries increased in five Districts. Demand for temporary workers was strong in Richmond and Minneapolis, while Chicago reported a decrease in billable hours. Seven Districts referred to shortages of skilled workers in several industries including retail, construction, manufacturing, accounting, and engineering. Looking ahead, contacts in the New York report anticipated a moderate increase in manufacturing payrolls and a faster rate of nonmanufacturing hiring in the second half; respondents in the Philadelphia report projected that the rate of hiring in the third quarter would match that of the second quarter; a temporary help agency in the Chicago region expected demand to firm in the second half; and in the Minneapolis District, more firms expected to increase payrolls than decrease.
Construction and Real Estate
Most Districts said that residential construction and real estate activity continued to decline on balance. Many Districts, however, noted increased activity in some individual market locales or segments. Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis said construction decreased. Boston and Kansas City said housing markets remained ""soft"" and ""weak,"" respectively, while San Francisco indicated that residential markets were weak and had slowed further in some areas. New York said markets were mixed but stable. Two notable exceptions were the Cleveland and Richmond regions, which experienced slight increases in sales. Atlanta said home inventories remained high, as did Dallas (even after a slight decline in the recent period). Inventories increased in Kansas City, but they declined in New York, and contacts in Boston and Cleveland described the number of homes for sale as ""normal"" and ""acceptable,"" respectively. District reports on home price appreciation were mixed: Boston noted a return to price appreciation and Kansas City indicated slower rates of decline. But Richmond and Chicago reported slower rates of increase or the beginning of declines, and in the Dallas District, some contacts projected a correction in entry-level home prices. Looking ahead, contacts in the Cleveland District were uncertain about how long it would be until the market turned, and analysts in Dallas had revised their housing outlook down. Contacts in Atlanta expected further declines overall, though they anticipated the market in Florida would be flat.
Commercial construction and real estate markets were generally more active than during the previous reporting period. New York said markets strengthened and San Francisco reported continued firming. Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City indicated small gains in development. Richmond and Dallas described local markets as still ""solid"" and ""robust,"" respectively. Chicago said the pace of development was steady, and St. Louis said markets were mixed. Richmond and Chicago observed that overall commercial vacancy rates were stable. Office vacancy rates fell in four regions. Demand for industrial space increased in four Districts, while net absorption in the Minneapolis District was negative. Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported increases in rental rates for commercial space, and New York said that the asking rents for space ""continued to soar.""
Manufacturing
Most District reports indicated that manufacturing activity continued to expand during June and early July. Richmond said that activity rebounded, and manufacturing appeared to expand in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco regions. Atlanta and Chicago pointed to general stability in the sector, while Kansas City and Dallas said activity ""slowed"" and ""cooled,"" respectively. Boston said half of their manufacturing respondents pointed to year-over-year declines while the rest said activity was expanding at ""normal"" rates.
In most Districts, the increases in demand for factory goods were spread across a number of industries. The sectors consistently mentioned as facing strong demand included fabricated metals, defense-related products, aerospace, rubber, and processed food. A number of Districts noted that strong export demand boosted activity. Cleveland reported auto production had increased and was expected to continue moving higher, and an auto parts maker in the St. Louis region planned to increase output. San Francisco reported generally steady demand for information technology products, but noted that semiconductor sales had increased. Chicago reported stronger-than-expected demand for agricultural machinery and projections of further gains in the second half of the year. In contrast, manufacturers of housing-related products (lumber, stone, glass, cement, appliances, and furniture) typically reported declines. Looking ahead, manufacturers in Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland expected activity to increase at a modest pace; the expectations of contacts in the Kansas City region improved; and manufacturers in the New York District expressed broad-based optimism. Cleveland noted that steel service centers expected to maintain or slow shipments in the third quarter, while a steel contact in the Chicago region thought that an inventory build would be needed by the end of the summer.
Banking and Finance
Household lending declined in most regions, while commercial and industrial lending expanded at a modest pace. New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted decreasing demand for mortgages, which in many cases was coupled with tighter underwriting standards. Cleveland indicated that consumer lending was flat to declining. In contrast, Philadelphia and Dallas reported that consumer lending was flat, and St. Louis said loans to individuals rose. Lenders in Philadelphia said it was unlikely they would meet their targets for this year, and bankers in Cleveland noted that they expected mortgage demand to remain weak into 2008. Interest rates on household loans increased in many Districts.
Business lending increased in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco regions, but lending appeared to be flat in Richmond and Kansas City. Three Districts said commercial real estate loans were a notable source of strength, though New York reported declines in these loans.
Household credit quality deteriorated marginally, while business credit quality remained mostly favorable. New York, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco observed higher delinquencies on mortgages and other consumer loans. Richmond reported an increase in commercial loan delinquencies, while Philadelphia said late payments on commercial real estate loans remained low, and Chicago indicated that business credit quality was unchanged. Cleveland and Dallas reported no change in overall credit quality. Deposits were up slightly in St. Louis, flat in Atlanta, flat to down in Cleveland, down in Kansas City, and ""difficult to obtain"" in Dallas.
Prices and Labor Costs
Contacts generally reported ongoing input cost pressures, particularly for petroleum-related inputs, while prices at the retail level continued to increase at a moderate rate. Notable exceptions were the Richmond District, which reported faster rates of price increases as local businesses passed along higher input costs, and the Kansas City region, which experienced an easing in overall price pressures. Almost every region said that oil and gasoline prices were either rising, high, or ""an issue."" But the cost of natural gas decreased in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts. Prices of some construction materials, such as lumber and cement, declined in parts of the country. A few Districts reported high prices for metals, notably copper. Trucking firms generally passed along higher fuel costs through surcharges, but shippers were unable to implement any other price increases. Prices of manufactured goods increased or were expected to increase further in the Boston region. But Minneapolis reported that fewer contacts than in the past expected to be able to increase the prices of their products, and Cleveland said wholesale prices were steady. New York indicated that retail prices were steady or increasing modestly, and Kansas City said they were flat or lower. Reports on vehicle incentives were mixed, with Chicago saying they were steady and Dallas pointing to new discounts. Restaurateurs in the Kansas City District expected to raise prices in the future due to the higher cost of fresh foods.
Many Districts described overall wage gains as moderate and/or similar to the previous reporting period. However, many also pointed to significant upward pressure on wages and salaries for in-demand, high-skilled workers.
Energy and Natural Resources
Energy extraction and refining activity continued at high levels in June and early July, with growth reported in four Districts. Deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and activity in the Kansas City District pushed up demand for drilling rigs, equipment, and personnel. Utilization rates for Louisiana Gulf Coast refineries remained high. The Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts cited the development of alternative energy projects. Mining activity was flat, though near capacity, in the Minneapolis District.
Agriculture
Agricultural conditions varied widely across regions. Above-average heat and a lack of moisture affected the Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts, while excess moisture impeded wheat and hay harvests in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. The Atlanta District bore the brunt of an expanding drought, which hurt crop development in the Chicago and Richmond Districts as well. Crop conditions were generally favorable in the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts. Forage and pastures were bad enough in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts that livestock herds were reduced, whereas pastures and ranges improved in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. Prices for many agricultural products increased during the reporting period, with corn, hogs, and cattle as notable exceptions. Due to price movements combined with higher feed costs, hog and cattle producers faced tightening margins. Increased exports supported agriculture, particularly in the San Francisco District.",0,0
2007-07-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand from mid-April through May. Seven banks described growth in their Districts as modest or moderate: Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco. Dallas reported growth as moderately strong, and Minneapolis said the District's economy edged up. Philadelphia reported that growth was somewhat faster than in recent months, and Richmond said growth picked up a bit. Boston characterized reports from its contacts as generally positive.
Consumer spending and retail sales were generally up in late April and May, with a number of Districts reporting that luxury items were selling better than lower-end merchandise. On net, there was little change in auto sales across the Districts, and dealers are about evenly split on whether there will be any pickup in sales over the summer. Travel and tourism remained healthy despite the recent rise in gas prices, although the rise in prices remains a concern for the summer. Except for trucking, reports from the service industries were generally positive. Declines were widely reported in the trucking industry, however. Manufacturing activity was up in a majority of Districts. There was weakness among manufacturers producing for the residential construction industry but strength among machinery and equipment manufacturers in several Districts.
There was continuing weakness in residential real estate and construction but increasing strength in the commercial real estate sector, including both office and industrial space. Half the District banks reported little or no change in overall loan demand, with strength in commercial lending and weakness in residential mortgages and consumer lending. In the agricultural sector, crop conditions improved and were generally described as good. An early spring frost harmed some winter wheat, and drought conditions caused problems in the Southeast and the far West. Oil and gas exploration increased in recent months, but coal production was down.
Hiring activity picked up in late April through May, especially for workers with specialized skills. But most Districts reported that overall wage pressures do not seem to have increased. There have been significant price increases for energy-related products and selected raw materials, but the prices of some raw materials have remained stable.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Consumer spending and retail sales were up in late April and May, but changes in consumer spending varied by category and by District. San Francisco reported moderate growth in sales, and Chicago reported a gradual increase in consumer spending. The majority of retail contacts in St. Louis said sales met or exceeded expectations. New York noted that retail sales were close to plan, with business particularly brisk in New York City. However, contacts in four Districts--Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas--noted that sales were disappointing or below expectations. Atlanta and Minneapolis described sales growth as marginal or modest. According to contacts in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco, luxury items were selling better than low-priced items. Several District banks reported weakness in sales of big ticket items such as furniture and household durables. Mall traffic was down in Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco suggest that higher gasoline prices may have restrained consumer spending on other items. Retailers in Boston, New York, Chicago, and St. Louis generally reported inventories at expected or desired levels. Philadelphia reported no major change in inventories, while Atlanta and Kansas City reported that inventories had risen. Looking forward, a majority of retailers in St. Louis see year-over-year sales increases this summer, and Philadelphia retailers see sales growth continuing at the current rate. But in Cleveland and Kansas City retailers anticipate slower or modest sales growth in the immediate future.
Auto sales were steady or little changed in five Districts: Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. They picked up in the last few months in Philadelphia from low levels earlier in the year, and they were above last year's level in St. Louis. Auto sales were down, however, in Atlanta and Kansas City. Dealers in St. Louis and Kansas City remain optimistic about a pickup in sales, but dealers in Philadelphia and Cleveland do not expect much change.
Spending on travel and tourism remained healthy despite the recent rise in gas prices. Spending by tourists was strong in Boston, New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and much of the San Francisco District. Reports from Boston, New York, and Kansas City mentioned higher rental rates for hotel rooms. Tourism was down, however, in Hawaii and in Michigan. Contacts in several Districts expressed concern that higher gas prices may negatively affect travel and tourism this summer.
Services
With the exception of trucking, growth in the service industries generally has been positive. Information technology services experienced double-digit growth year over year in the Boston area. Both Dallas and San Francisco reported solid demand for IT services. Minneapolis mentioned growth in professional services generally, and Dallas reported strong demand for corporate legal services and accounting.
In the trucking and shipping industry, sluggish demand or declines were noted in half the Districts: Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Dallas was the only District to mention a pickup in the trucking business.
Manufacturing
Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity was up in the most recent period. Growth rates varied by industry group, however, and some Districts experienced little or no overall growth. Cleveland and Chicago reported stable conditions or little change in the manufacturing sector. St. Louis said manufacturing activity was mixed. Richmond is the only District that reported a decline in manufacturing activity. Some Districts (Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco) mentioned that industries producing for the residential construction market were weak. On the other hand, four Districts--Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago--mentioned that there was strength among machinery and equipment manufacturers. While several Districts mentioned capital spending plans, reports on capital spending from Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City were particularly positive. Both New York and Philadelphia noted that manufacturers were optimistic about growth over the remainder of this year. Manufacturers in Boston and Cleveland expected little change in activity.
Real Estate and Construction
The real estate and construction industries were marked by continued weakness in the residential sector and increasing strength in the commercial sector. Most Districts characterized their housing markets as soft or weak. San Francisco reported that sales volumes for both new and existing homes fell further in most areas, with modest price declines in some parts of the District. Minneapolis described the District's housing markets as mostly weak, and Dallas described the District's housing markets as soft, noting high cancellation rates for new home sales in Dallas and continued slowing in the Houston market. Philadelphia reported no improvement in the housing market, and Cleveland reported that new home sales were stable but prices were down. Atlanta reported that sales stabilized at low levels in parts of Florida but continued to decline in Georgia. Reports from Richmond and St. Louis were mixed, with sales stabilizing or improving in some areas but declining in others. The most positive report on housing markets came from the New York District where there were signs of strengthening in New York City, parts of Long Island, and some close-in New Jersey suburbs. However, housing markets in the rest of the New York District remain sluggish. No District reported an increase in new home construction. Moreover, inventories and days on the market continue to rise in some Districts, although the Kansas City District has seen a reduction in inventories. Realtors in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta Districts anticipate that the weakness in the housing market will last several more months at least.
There was widespread improvement in commercial real estate markets in recent months. More than half the Districts reported that leasing activity was picking up in most of their major markets and vacancy rates were falling. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco also mentioned increases in office rents. Four Districts (Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas) reported strong demand for industrial space, especially warehouse space. Chicago, on the other hand, reported that industrial development was sluggish. All the Districts that mentioned commercial construction activity gave positive reports.
Banking and Finance
Half the Districts reported little or no change in overall loan demand: New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Philadelphia noted that loans were increasing at a steady pace, and San Francisco reported further growth in loan demand. There was more strength in commercial lending than in consumer lending. About half the Districts noted increases in commercial lending, and growth in commercial lending was reported to be solid or strong in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas. Kansas City, on the other hand, experienced an easing of C&I loans except for commercial real estate. Consumer lending increased at a steady pace in Philadelphia, and lending for autos and marine equipment was up in Cleveland. But Dallas saw a decline in lending for autos.
Residential mortgage lending was either declining or flat in all the Districts reporting except New York, where there was a pickup in mortgage lending. New York, Atlanta, and Chicago mentioned higher mortgage delinquencies. In Philadelphia and Cleveland lenders have little or no expectation of a pickup in mortgage lending through the rest of this year. Credit standards are mostly unchanged, except for home mortgages in New York and commercial real estate in St. Louis.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
In most Districts crop conditions were described as good or improving. But Chicago reported that crop conditions were mixed, ranging from ""stunted"" to ""excellent."" A spring frost in parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Kansas caused damage to the winter wheat crop. Drought conditions in the Southeast and in parts of the San Francisco District hindered crop development and harmed pasture land. In the San Francisco District some cattle were brought to market early because of the lack of adequate grazing land. A number of Districts noted higher prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat. The higher cost of feed grains has resulted in higher prices for cattle and hogs.
Exploration and development of oil and gas increased in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts. The rig count was up modestly in the Kansas City District, and the number of rigs is expected to continue to increase. Rig counts have remained stable in Texas, but they are at relatively high levels. Older rigs, however, are being refurbished. Oil and gas development was described as high in Cleveland and production as flat to slightly up. But coal production is down in the Cleveland District. Minneapolis reported that mining production was flat but the industry was producing at near capacity.
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
Several District reports mentioned that hiring activity increased in the late April through May time period. Staffing agencies in Boston and New York noted that demand was high for workers in information technology, medical, and financial service industries. Several Districts mentioned that the market for workers with specialized skills was tight. On the other hand, layoffs continued among home builders and in the manufacturing and service industries associated with home building. Wage increases were variously described as modest (Atlanta), steady (Philadelphia), or moderate (Minneapolis and San Francisco). Kansas City reported that while wages were up, wage pressures had eased since the previous report.
More than half the Districts mentioned higher energy prices for both producers and consumers. Several Districts (Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas) reported rising prices for selected raw materials, such as copper. Atlanta and Chicago noted, however, that prices for raw materials were steady or even down. There were differing reports on the costs of construction materials. Kansas City reported that construction costs were mixed. Atlanta said the cost of construction materials was lower, and Dallas said the cost of building materials was moving up. At the consumer level both Kansas City and Dallas mentioned the rising cost of food. However, District reports generally did not indicate an increase in overall price pressures. For example, Chicago noted that price pressures were similar to the last report, and San Francisco observed that overall price inflation seemed to be modest.
",0,1
2007-05-31,"Most Federal Reserve Districts noted only modest or moderate expansions in economic activity since the previous report, however two--New York and Minneapolis--reported steady and firm growth, respectively, and Dallas characterized growth as moderately strong.
Reports on retail sales across the Districts were generally positive, although vehicle sales were mixed in several Districts. Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity was slow, with many reports of weakening among manufacturers that support the residential construction sector. Economic activity in the services sector continued to increase across most Districts, especially for firms serving business customers. Tourism activity was generally positive. Residential real estate activity continued to weaken, with sales declining in many Districts and flat in a number of others. Boston, however, noted improving residential markets, with some increases in sales volume. Several Districts also reported declining homebuilding activity. Commercial real estate markets continued to be active, with several reports of robust commercial construction activity. Several Districts noted little or no growth in overall lending activity, but San Francisco noted generally solid loan demand. Reports of weakening residential mortgage activity continued to offset reports of increases in commercial and industrial lending. Agricultural conditions were mixed in recent weeks across the Districts. Activity in the energy and mining sectors has remained at high levels since the previous report.
Most Districts reported continuing tight labor market conditions, especially for skilled occupations. Several Districts noted faster wage growth for skilled workers, but only modest overall wage increases.

Wage pressures were associated with tightening conditions in a few Districts, though other reports noted that wage pressures were in check. While the majority of Districts characterized price pressures as contained, input prices increased in several Districts and a few reports mentioned increased pass throughs by businesses.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Most Districts reported stronger growth in consumer spending, although automobile and housing-related sales generally weakened. Solid back-to-school sales helped boost retail revenues in the Philadelphia, Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts. Chicago said back-to-school sales were within expectations, though ""nothing stellar."" Sales of upscale merchandise picked up in the New York District, while apparel sales grew more quickly in the Boston, Cleveland and San Francisco Districts. Chain department store sales were stronger in the Richmond District and same-store sales increased in the New York District. Softer residential real estate conditions damped home improvement and furniture sales in the New York, Richmond, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts.
Vehicle sales weakened in several Districts--particularly sales of domestic automobiles, SUVs and light trucks. However, a few Districts reported increased sales of foreign cars and fuel-efficient automobiles. Philadelphia noted that a growing number of smaller automobile dealerships had closed and dealers in the Atlanta District added incentives to move inventory. In the Dallas District, sales of luxury vehicles increased.
Tourist activity strengthened since our last report. New York said that tourism remained robust in New York City. Kansas City reported solid gains in hotel occupancy rates, while tourist activity in the San Francisco District remained at a high level despite some moderation. Tourism in the Richmond District was temporarily dented by Hurricane Ernesto in early September, but rebounded later in the month.
Services
Activity in the service sector generally strengthened across Districts since the last report. The Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts reported increased demand for professional and technical services. Boston reported increased demand for consulting and financial services, and along with San Francisco, for healthcare services. Richmond indicated that demand for computer and web-based services firmed and San Francisco noted that demand for media services was stronger. Assessments of transportation services were mixed. Trucking firms reported declining volume in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta and Dallas Districts, and in Cleveland, shipping services continued to soften. Chicago said trucking volume was up slightly and cargo shipping increased in the Dallas District. St. Louis reported that freight transportation companies planned expansions. Atlanta indicated that rail companies experienced steady growth in inter-modal shipment volume, and Dallas said that rail demand was strong.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity remained generally strong in most Districts. Eight of the twelve Districts indicated that factory output increased, while Chicago and Kansas City noted that the pace of expansion slowed. Minneapolis described factory activity as mixed and Philadelphia reported that factory production edged down. The output of energy-related equipment increased in the Boston, Atlanta and Dallas Districts, while Chicago and San Francisco indicated that orders for machine tools increased. San Francisco reported that semiconductor sales were solid. The demand for steel was especially strong according to Atlanta and Chicago, while Cleveland and Chicago noted that heavy equipment sales continued to be robust. Chicago also reported strength in heavy-duty truck production. In contrast, St. Louis said that producers of motor vehicle parts announced plans to lay off workers and Cleveland reported weakness in the auto industry. Reports of softer demand for housing-related products continued to be widespread, but Dallas noted that strong demand from the commercial construction industry helped offset softer residential demand. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco said that sales of food products had accelerated since our last report.
Construction and Real Estate
Nearly all Districts reported that housing market conditions continued to soften, though several noted that activity increased in some markets. Most Districts reported higher home inventories, and several said that homebuilders and sellers continued to offer incentives to attract buyers. Softer home demand in San Francisco led to layoffs for mortgage brokers and real estate agents. Residential construction remained weak in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts except in western North Dakota where residential construction was described as ""robust."" New home inventories inched up in the Dallas District despite strong demand in some of its markets and inventories of single family homes and condominiums rose sharply in the Boston District.
New York and St. Louis reported mixed housing activity. On the upside, Manhattan condominium sales showed signs of resilience, and housing sales rose in Memphis, but both Districts noted weakness in most markets. Richmond reported generally weaker housing activity, but also noted increases in some markets. Atlanta said that housing activity rose in its Mississippi Gulf market, and Minneapolis' Sioux Falls market remained on pace with last year's record-breaking level. Dallas reported particularly robust home sales in its Houston, Austin and El Paso markets.
Commercial real estate markets were strong in most Districts, and activity increased at a faster pace in a number. Leasing activity increased in New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco, and held steady in Richmond. Chicago and St. Louis, however, said leasing activity was mixed. Rent increases were reported by New York, Minneapolis and San Francisco, with Dallas indicating that pricing power was shifting to landlords.
Nonresidential construction was generally strong. Construction activity was steady in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts and increased in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Material costs and budget concerns scaled back some projects in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. The Chicago and Minneapolis reports noted concerns among some contacts that commercial construction may slow in the coming months.
Banking and Finance
Lending activity was mixed as increases in commercial lending were offset by further weakness in residential mortgage lending. The New York, Richmond and Chicago Districts reported declines in overall loan demand, while Philadelphia, St. Louis and Kansas City reported modest increases. Demand for residential mortgages slowed in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts; held steady in the Richmond and Dallas Districts; and declined in the New York District. The commercial lending market was characterized as very competitive by Richmond, Chicago and Dallas. Overall credit quality remained generally good, although increases in mortgage delinquency rates were noted by Philadelphia, Cleveland and Atlanta. Tighter standards for commercial loans were reported by New York and Chicago.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Agriculture conditions generally improved as late summer rainfall brought relief to drought-stricken Districts, although some rains hindered field work in some areas and damaged crops in others. Richmond indicated that tropical storm Ernesto severely damaged crops along some coastal areas. Chicago and St. Louis reported that recent precipitation and unseasonably cool weather delayed corn and soybean harvests. Crop yields in the Minneapolis District improved with the rainfall, though Chicago reported that yield prospects were mixed. In the Kansas City District, cooler weather and scattered rainfall restored soil moisture and pastures conditions, though cattle producers continued to draw down herds. Dallas, however, said that while September rains assisted wheat producers and eased pressure on livestock producers to liquidate herds, many parts of the District still needed rain. San Francisco reported strong sales for livestock and most crops but indicated that spinach producers put planting on hold.
Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis indicated that alternative energy industries continued to expand at a rapid pace and that mining production was at near-capacity across the District. Kansas City noted that oil and gas drilling rig counts remained above year-ago levels, while San Francisco said that oil and natural gas extraction continued at a rapid pace. In contrast, Dallas reported that activity in the oil and energy producing sector was virtually unchanged although demand for oil-field equipment and energy services remained strong.
Employment, Wages, Prices
Labor market conditions remained taut since our last report. The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis and Dallas reports characterized labor markets as generally tight, particularly for skilled workers, while the remaining Districts noted that job growth was steady to stronger. Six Districts mentioned labor shortages, particularly for professional, scientific, and other technical workers. In addition, Kansas City said retailers faced shortages of experienced sales workers and Atlanta indicated that residential construction firms were having difficulty obtaining qualified construction workers, despite the slowdown in building activity. In contrast, Cleveland reported that roughly half of the homebuilders they contacted had reduced their labor force.
Wage growth around the nation was generally modest, although faster wage growth for skilled services workers was cited by a number of Districts. The San Francisco District noted that a short supply of healthcare, finance and construction workers pushed wages higher. In addition, Richmond noted a sharp uptick in retail wages and Atlanta reported that some manufacturers had raised entry-level wages in an effort to attract workers.
Most Districts reported few signs of increased price pressures in recent weeks. A number of Districts said that energy prices moderated, but increases in raw materials prices were noted by Philadelphia, Richmond and Atlanta, and a rise in building materials prices was reported by Minneapolis. Instances of businesses passing on higher costs were scattered across Districts; Cleveland and Atlanta said some manufacturers attempted to raise output prices while Boston reported increases in retail prices. Boston also reported that costs for some businesses had increased--especially for airfare and hotel accommodations. Likewise, the New York District noted that accommodation and theatre ticket prices had risen sharply compared to a year ago.
",0,1
2006-10-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity continued to expand since the last report, but five Districts indicated deceleration while the remaining seven reported little change in the pace of growth. Some slowing in economic growth was seen in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, though Dallas still characterized growth as strong. Most other Districts reported continued modest growth, though Atlanta described activity as ""mixed"", Richmond observed that growth was ""slow,"" while San Francisco noted a ""solid"" growth pace.
Consumer spending increased slowly in most Districts, weighed down by sluggish sales of vehicles and housing-related goods. While a number of districts noted some bloating in automobile inventories, most non-auto retailers indicated satisfaction with inventory levels. Tourism was generally characterized as steady but relatively strong. Reports on the service sector varied by industry and by district: some found the trucking and information technology industries to be relatively strong, but others provided mixed reports on air transportation and health care. Manufacturing activity continued to expand in all districts, despite pockets of weakness mostly related to autos and residential construction. Reports on real estate and construction were uniformly weak for the residential sector, but fairly widespread strength was recounted in the commercial sector. Financial institutions reported some softening in loan demand, especially for home mortgages, but noted that credit quality was still favorable. Drought-like conditions in much of the nation have hampered crop production and livestock while energy production remained at a high level.
Labor markets were mostly described as steady since the last report, with scattered labor shortages and associated upward wage pressures noted in a number of Districts, especially for workers with specialized skills. Widespread increases in the prices of energy and certain other commodities persisted since the last report, though most of these increases do not appear to have passed through to finished consumer goods.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Consumer spending increased modestly in most Districts since the last report, though a few Districts reported flat to declining sales. In general, sales of autos and home-improvement and other home-related goods tended to be weaker than for other categories. A number of Districts also indicate that persistently high energy prices are perceived to have crimped consumer demand in general. Overall, retail sales were described as growing modestly in nine Districts: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco. The Richmond and St. Louis Districts noted weak or declining sales while Cleveland described sales as mixed. Vehicle sales were reported to have weakened in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts; however, a pickup in auto sales was indicated in the Chicago District. Vehicle sales were described as mixed in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco Districts; all four noted a shift in demand toward more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Aside from automobiles, retail inventories were generally reported to be at favorable levels, where specified--in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. Kansas City reported a slight decline in the share of store managers satisfied with inventory levels. However, excessive vehicle inventories were reported in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, and contacts in the Kansas City District anticipate a build-up of vehicle inventories in the months ahead.
Tourism was, on balance, little changed from the last report. The New York, Atlanta and San Francisco Districts indicated continued high levels of tourism activity. Activity was described as mixed in the Richmond and Chicago Districts and as weaker in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts.
Services
Activity in the service sector was mixed across Districts and across industries since the last report. Regarding the broad service sector overall, Richmond reported an acceleration in service firms' revenues, St. Louis and San Francisco indicated steady growth while New York indicated some slowing in activity. The transportation industry was mixed since the last report. Strong or increased overall activity was reported in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts; Richmond reported that airports' revenue accelerated. In contrast, St. Louis and Dallas indicated some softening in the airline industry, and Cleveland noted some moderation in trucking and shipping activity. Boston reported steady growth in business at software and IT service firms. The Richmond and San Francisco Districts characterized the health care industry as robust, whereas the St. Louis District indicated impending layoffs in that industry.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity was reported as generally expanding in all Districts, and contacts were optimistic that activity would continue to grow in the months ahead. While the pace of manufacturing activity had slowed in the New York, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts, it was reported as increasing in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts.
Factory activity was reported as declining in some sectors but increasing in others. Several Districts reported a decline in activity in the motor vehicle industry, although Cleveland noted that some of this decline was likely seasonal; Chicago said that heavy-duty truck production and demand for heavy equipment continued to be strong. Steel demand also remained strong according to the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Activity was reported as rising in aircraft and defense sectors. Reports of slowing in activity related to residential construction and housing-related products were widespread, although demand related to non-residential construction activity was reported as improving. The production of apparel was also cited as having slowed. Energy-related manufacturing activity continued to rise strongly, and capital goods output was reported as generally growing in most Districts.
Real Estate and Construction
Housing markets and home construction activity weakened throughout the nation, but commercial real estate and construction strengthened in most Districts. Virtually all Districts reported declines in home sales, as well as in residential construction activity. Moreover, most Districts indicated substantial increases in the inventory of unsold homes; Kansas City attributed some of this increase to ""sizable numbers of foreclosures"" in some areas. In general, residential real estate contacts expected that housing markets would remain weak, if not weaken further, in the months ahead; such concerns were specified in the reports from Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City.
Relatively flat or declining home prices were noted in the New York, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts, and decelerating prices were reported in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts. The high end of the market was described as particularly weak in the Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, as well as parts of the Minneapolis District. In contrast, the high ends of both the Dallas District's housing market and the New York District's co-op and condo market were reported to have experienced less softening than the more moderately priced segments. One area of relative strength in residential real estate has been the apartment market--of the three Districts reporting on this, New York and Chicago both indicate fairly strong demand for apartment rentals since the last report, while Dallas noted continued strong demand for condominiums.
Commercial real estate markets were uniformly described as strong and, in most cases, increasingly so. Office markets showed noticeable signs of improvement in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. However, market conditions were described as mixed in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. The reports on markets for industrial space were not as uniformly positive: Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta reported some firming, whereas Minneapolis noted some softening; industrial markets were described as generally steady in the New York and St. Louis Districts.
With widespread tightening in commercial real estate markets, most Districts also reported increases in commercial development and construction. Increased office construction was reported in the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis also reported a pickup in industrial construction while Cleveland and Dallas reported increases in retail development. Public construction activity was described as strong in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts.
Banking and Finance
Banks reported mixed but generally slowing trends in lending activity during the summer, with softening demand most evident in the household sector, especially for home mortgages. The New York, Cleveland, Atlanta and Chicago Districts reported declines in overall loan demand, while the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts reported increases. However, reports of soft and/or weakening demand for residential mortgages were more widespread, as highlighted in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Although refinancing was generally described as soft, both Richmond and Chicago noted an uptick in such activity, which was attributed to homeowners looking to lock in fixed rates. Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts but weakened in the New York and Kansas City Districts.
Overall credit quality was generally described as good, and delinquency rates were little changed in most Districts, though a few noted scattered increases. The New York and Philadelphia Districts reported modest increases in delinquencies on home mortgages, and Cleveland noted a slight increase in the commercial segment. Credit standards were reported to be steady to slightly tighter.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Drought and near-drought conditions persisted throughout much of the country, depressing crop production and livestock sustainability. Conditions were distressed in the Atlanta, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. Dallas reported that more than 50 percent of key crops were in poor shape, and the consequent acceleration of the liquidation of cattle is expected to cut beef supplies significantly over the next few years. Weather conditions improved somewhat in the Kansas City District; nonetheless, the region's crops continued to suffer from prior drought conditions, and cattle producers there also plan faster liquidation of herds. St. Louis reported mixed conditions. The bright spots were in the Chicago District, where above-average rains reduced stress and improved the crop outlook from earlier drought conditions, and in the San Francisco District, where conditions were reported as favorable.
The demand for oil and natural gas was reported as continuing to be robust, and facilities were operating near capacity. But several reports indicated some softening in natural gas prices. Drilling and exploration activity was reported as rising slightly, but constrained by capacity constraints, with the Dallas District noting that some drilling activity had shifted away from natural gas and toward oil. Mining activity was reported as robust.
Labor Markets
Labor markets around the nation have generally been steady since the last report. Scattered labor shortages continued to be reported in a number of Districts, though these do not appear to have intensified, except in the Dallas District. Job growth was described as brisk in the Kansas City District, and recent acceleration was noted in the Richmond District. Labor markets were characterized as steady or expanding moderately in the other ten Districts. The Kansas City and Dallas Districts reported fairly widespread labor shortages while more specific shortages were cited in a number of other Districts: Cleveland indicated a shortage of truck drivers, Atlanta noted ongoing shortages of construction and hospitality workers along the Gulf Coast (where Hurricane Katrina struck a year ago); Chicago reported shortages of skilled manufacturing workers and engineers; and Minneapolis mentioned some shortages in Michigan's northern peninsula.
Wage pressures were reported in a number of Districts, though they were most often limited to certain sectors and most pronounced for workers with specialized skills. Overall increases in wage pressures were mentioned in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. A number of other Districts reported sharp wage increases or wage pressures for such workers in occupations that are in short supply or for workers in particular industries, such as information technology (Boston), trucking (Cleveland), retail trade (Chicago), and financial and health services (San Francisco).
Prices
Reports of sustained increases in the cost of metals, energy and petroleum-based products, and other raw materials continued to be widespread, although increases in energy costs were reported as moderating in the San Francisco District. Some Districts reported flat to declining prices for natural gas and a moderation in the price of steel. Manufacturers found little ability to pass through higher costs into the prices of manufactured goods, with the exception of energy-intensive goods and services as reported by the San Francisco District. Many Districts reported lower prices for apparel and electronic goods, and most Districts reported that retail prices remained steady.",0,1
2006-08-31,"Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally indicated continued economic growth during June through mid-July, with numerous individual reports pointing to evidence that the pace of growth has slowed. Several Districts characterized the overall pace of economic growth as ""moderate"" or ""modest,"" although San Francisco reported that its economic expansion remained ""solid"" and Atlanta and St. Louis described overall conditions as ""mixed."" The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reports each highlighted a decline in the overall rate of economic growth in their Districts.
Most reports on retail sales indicated slightly weaker conditions, on balance, than earlier in the year. But tourist spending remained robust, albeit with evidence of slower growth in some areas, and activity expanded for providers of nonfinancial services to businesses and consumers. Reports from the manufacturing sector were strong, with significant gains in output and sales, especially for durable goods. Producers in the agricultural and natural-resource sectors also saw strong demand, although some weather-related difficulties and other supply constraints were noted. Activity in residential real estate markets cooled in most parts of the country, but various Districts reported an ongoing pickup in demand for commercial space. Among financial institutions, lending activity mirrored developments in the economy more generally: commercial and industrial lending expanded further, while most Districts reported a decline in residential mortgage lending and some noted reduced demand for consumer loans.
Increases in wages and in prices of final goods and services remained modest on net. Upward pressure from the elevated prices of energy and other inputs persisted; while this pressure increased further in some cases, a few Districts noted a moderation in prices for some items. Scattered reports from various Districts indicated an increase in manufacturers' and retailers' ability to pass such cost increases on to final prices. More generally, however, Districts reported that vigorous competition held price increases down, and some contacts noted reliance on productivity increases to maintain profit margins in the face of rising input costs. Labor markets tightened a bit further in most areas. Increases in base wages and salaries generally remained moderate, but they were relatively rapid for workers with specialized skills in a wide range of sectors.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Many reports indicated that consumer spending on retail goods weakened slightly during the survey period. Although most Districts reported gains in retail sales compared with a year earlier, they generally characterized the pace of growth as modest or disappointing. Retail sales were ""mixed"" or ""varied"" in Boston, New York, and Atlanta, ""flat"" in Richmond, ""cooling"" in Dallas, and ""below expectations"" in Chicago and San Francisco.
Most Districts reported that sales gains for department stores and smaller retail establishments were limited or below retailers' expectations. Sales were healthy for luxury retailers but relatively weak among ""big box"" retailers and other low-price outlets. Cleveland and Chicago reported that general retail spending was held down in part by high gas prices, which have squeezed households' budgets and reduced the frequency of shopping trips.
In general, sales of automobiles and light trucks were flat to down. Sales remained healthier for imported vehicles than for domestic makes despite the revival of sales incentives for the latter, as high gas prices continued to nudge buyers towards fuel-efficient models. Inventories reportedly were undesirably high for SUVs and light trucks in some areas.
Activity in the travel and tourism sector generally remained at high levels or increased further, although a few reports indicated that the pace of growth has slowed. New York noted that occupancy rates in Manhattan recently edged down from very high levels. Performance was mixed in Richmond's tourism sector, and Kansas City and Minneapolis reported that summer tourism activity has been at or only slightly above year-earlier levels. Atlanta reported ""cautious optimism"" in the tourist trade and increased tourist traffic to Florida destinations, while San Francisco reported that tourist activity increased further from very high levels in Hawaii and other destinations throughout the West.
Nonfinancial Services
Activity in the nonfinancial services sectors generally expanded further, although the pace of growth reportedly slowed in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts. Providers of business and professional services, such as advertising, accounting, management consulting, and technology services, saw solid demand in general and increased activity in the Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts. Providers of permanent and temporary employee placement services were quite active, with modest or better increases in hiring reported in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas Districts. Reports on the health-care sector were mixed, with ""brisk"" activity reported by San Francisco but Richmond noting that activity was ""flat to lower.""
Reports on the transportation sector suggested further increases in activity on net. Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas pointed to recent expansion in rail freight and trucking activity, and San Francisco reported strong demand for transportation services. By contrast, Cleveland and Chicago noted slight declines in trucking tonnage and rail tonnage, respectively, with the latter attributed to reduced shipments of construction materials.
Manufacturing
Reports on manufacturing activity indicated significant gains across most Districts during June and July. The only slightly weak reports came from New York, where manufacturers reported decelerating activity in July in the wake of a strong June, and St. Louis, where manufacturing conditions were mixed.
Among products, demand was especially vigorous for various durable goods. Substantial sales gains were reported for makers of electrical equipment and information technology products such as semiconductors, along with further increases in orders and activity for makers of commercial aircraft and products used for national defense. The reports also pointed to a further rise in demand for makers of heavy equipment, machine tools, and steel, offset in part by reduced demand for smaller equipment that is oriented towards residential construction activity. Demand for building materials was mixed but generally positive. Atlanta reported a drop in demand for concrete, but Chicago reported strong demand for wallboard, and Richmond and Minneapolis noted further increases in the production of fabricated metals. Among nondurable products, the reports indicated strong demand and further growth for chemicals, plastics, textiles, and processed food.
The Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts noted that capacity utilization was high in various manufacturing sectors and increased a bit further in general. Looking ahead, manufacturers in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts reported plans to increase their capital spending over the balance of the year, but in the Kansas City District expectations for future capital spending remained low.
Real Estate and Construction
With only scattered exceptions, Districts reported slower activity in residential real estate markets. For new and existing homes, available reports indicated that the pace of sales declined and that the inventory of available homes and time on the market rose in most major metropolitan areas nationwide. Slower sales activity has translated into more limited price gains, and residential construction activity has fallen in most Districts as well.
The St. Louis and Dallas Districts were exceptions to the general slowdown in residential market activity. In the St. Louis District, the pace of home sales was largely unchanged or up slightly compared with a year earlier, although residential construction slowed there. Housing markets have remained resilient in the Dallas District, where despite signs of cooling, ""home demand remains strong"" and residential building activity has been ""robust.""
As home demand has slipped more generally, scattered reports indicated a strengthening in demand for rental units. New York reported that the market for apartment rentals has been tightening in Manhattan, and according to Atlanta slower condominium sales in Florida have prompted owners to convert some units to rental property.
Slower activity on the residential side was offset in part by firmer activity on the commercial side. Demand for commercial space was strong in general, and the market tightened further in most Districts. Commercial construction activity was at high levels and increased further in the Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond Districts. By contrast, Chicago reported a modest slowdown in commercial construction activity, and Kansas City noted that ""commercial real estate activity was mostly flat.""
Builders in some areas faced moderate constraints on construction activity. High construction costs reportedly were a restraining factor that delayed or caused the cancellation of some building projects in the Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Moreover, Atlanta reported that some commercial building projects along the Gulf Coast have been put on hold until late fall, after the current hurricane season is over.
Banking and Finance
Overall lending activity remained strong on net but growth slowed in most Districts, as continued strength in business loans was offset by further weakening in loans to households. On the business side, commercial and industrial lending generally was at high levels and rose further in many Districts. The main exceptions were Richmond, where rising interest rates reportedly contributed to a decline in commercial lending, and Atlanta, where commercial lending ""remained slow overall.""
Loans to households weakened somewhat in most Districts, as ongoing declines in mortgage lending were reinforced by slightly slower consumer lending in some areas. Most Districts reported a reduction in the pace of mortgage lending, although St. Louis saw a slight increase. While consumer lending was reported to be stable in a few Districts, it slowed somewhat in the St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. New York noted overall weakening in loan demand, with especially pronounced declines for consumer loans and mortgages for commercial real estate. In most Districts, credit quality remained high across all loan categories.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Reports indicated further expansion of demand for most agricultural and natural-resource products, but growing conditions for crops in some regions were hampered by dry weather. Demand was strong for most crops and livestock products, and prices generally remained firm even for products in ample supply. Dry conditions constrained growing in the Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and Atlanta Districts, holding yields on corn, cotton, and other crops below normal levels. Dry conditions also caused pasture deterioration in the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, increasing operating costs for livestock producers and prompting some to reduce or liquidate herds. By contrast, dry weather contributed to healthy crop conditions for corn, cotton, and other items in the St. Louis District. High input prices reportedly squeezed agricultural profit margins in some areas, with Chicago noting an increase in farmers' reliance on operating loans and Kansas City reporting an expected drop in farm incomes this year.
Activity was robust in the natural-resources sector. Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported further increases in extraction activities for oil and natural gas. Demand for labor and equipment was strong, and some producers reported labor shortages and difficulties obtaining needed materials and equipment. Producers of natural gas continued to operate at high levels, although Dallas and San Francisco reported that inventories have risen substantially, causing prices to decline.
Prices and Wages
Increases in prices of final goods and services generally remained modest, despite the pressures from high prices for selected inputs and further increases for some. Manufacturers' and retailers' ability to pass cost increases on to final prices varied. Providers of transportation services have been able to apply fuel surcharges, significantly increasing the price of their services in some areas over the past year. In addition, Atlanta noted rising prices charged by various service providers, and Kansas City reported an increase in the percentage of manufacturers reporting higher prices on finished goods. Other reports indicated more limited pricing power and smaller increases in final prices. Richmond reported that retail prices rose at a slower pace in recent weeks, and Kansas City reported that recent and planned increases in retail prices were unchanged from the previous survey period. Dallas noted that weaker demand of late reduced firms' ability to raise prices in some industries.
District reports indicated that labor markets were tight in general and tightened a bit further in most areas. Increases in base wages and salaries generally remained moderate overall, with scattered indications of faster growth for some workers. San Francisco noted that numerical reports on wage increases generally were in the range of 3 to 4 percent. In the Kansas City District, the fraction of firms reporting ""above-normal"" wage increases edged up, and Dallas reported significant pay increases for workers employed through temporary services firms. Wage increases remained relatively rapid for skilled workers in many areas, including managerial and professional employees and those with specialized occupational skills in a variety of industries. Moreover, New York reported that the market for recent college graduates has tightened, with starting salaries up 7 percent over the past year in that city.",0,1
2006-07-31,"Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity continued to expand from mid-April to early June, but there were some signs of deceleration. Activity moderated in four Districts--Atlanta, Kansas City, Richmond, and San Francisco--and the New York District noted increased concern about the outlook for the second half. Seven Districts--Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, and St. Louis--said growth was similar to the pace reported in the last Beige Book. The Philadelphia District, however, reported an improvement in overall economic conditions.
Consumer spending continued to increase, but District reports suggest that the growth rate slowed. Manufacturing activity still expanded quite strongly, but reports indicate more areas of weakness than in March and early April. Residential real estate markets continued to cool across the country, with slower homebuilding and sales of existing homes. In contrast, commercial real estate activity strengthened, and a few reports expressed concern about too much building in some portions of the real estate market. Activity in service-producing industries was strong or increased in all Districts that reported on that sector. The financial sector continues to report good credit quality. Commercial lending picked up, but there was some slowing in loans to consumers, particularly for mortgages and home equity loans. Growth in the energy industry continued to be robust, with expansion constrained by shortages of equipment and labor. Agricultural conditions varied across the country.
Labor markets continued to tighten, with more Districts reporting employers having difficulty finding skilled workers. Wage pressures remained moderate overall, with the exception being workers with hotly demanded skills. High energy costs were fueling price increases in manufacturing and, to a much lesser extent, retail. Reports of costs being passed forward varied considerably but were more prevalent than in the last Beige Book.
Consumer Spending Consumer spending continued to increase between mid-April and early June, but reports were varied, and several Districts noted areas of weakness. Some Districts mentioned that sales were slowing or weaker than anticipated at discount stores or to lower income customers. High gasoline prices were cited by a few Districts as changing purchasing patterns or clouding the outlook for sales. A couple of Districts also said that rising interest rates were a concern. Inventories were mostly reported to be at desirable levels, but the Atlanta, Boston, and Kansas City Districts said some retailers had more inventory than they would like.
Two Districts reported weaker retail sales growth--Dallas and Richmond--and retail sales were ""down"" compared with last year in the St. Louis District. The Boston and New York Districts said results were ""mixed,"" but Boston added that the majority of retailers cited soft year-over-year sales gains. Three Districts--Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco--reported little change in retail sales. Philadelphia said sales in its District increased from April to May, but gains were ""varied"" among stores. The Atlanta District reported that sales rose at a ""solid pace"" but ""some segments reported lower demand."" Improving trends were reported by the Cleveland District, and the Chicago District said consumer spending continued to ""increase modestly.""
Most reports about auto sales suggested weakness, with particularly poor sales of SUVs and light trucks. Auto sales were reported as ""sluggish"" or ""down"" in the Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Philadelphia Districts. Atlanta reported that sales were ""mixed,"" and Kansas City said auto sales were unchanged from last month but lower than a year ago. Sales increased in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, but some dealers in the Dallas District reported sizable excess inventory because sales were less than expected over the winter months. The Chicago and St. Louis Districts also reported that inventories were higher than desired, and the Philadelphia District said dealers had limited their orders to manufacturers to keep inventories in check. The Kansas City District reported that inventory levels were satisfactory.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing sector continued to expand quite strongly, but with more reports of softening than at the time of the last Beige Book survey. Strong activity was noted in the production of goods to supply the energy, semiconductor, and aerospace industries. Areas of weakness included production of agricultural equipment and autos. Slower demand for goods to supply residential building, most notably lumber, was mentioned by a few Districts, although the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported demand for construction-related materials still remained strong overall.
Manufacturing activity was characterized as ""strong"" or ""up solidly"" in the Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts. The San Francisco District reported that activity expanded overall, with production of commercial aircraft near full capacity and capacity utilization of semiconductor manufacturers at or above 90 percent. Production was ""steady to increasing"" in the Cleveland District, and firms continued to report generally favorable conditions in the New York District. Activity continued to expand in the Minneapolis and St. Louis Districts. Two Districts--Philadelphia and Richmond--noted some softening or leveling of growth. The Atlanta District said activity remained mixed.
Services
The Boston, Dallas, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts report ""strong"" or ""robust"" activity throughout the service-producing sector. Demand for workers at temporary employment firms picked up in the Chicago, Dallas, and Richmond Districts, while contacts in the Boston, Dallas, and New York Districts indicated ""steady"" and ""solid"" activity. Business activity at information technology service firms grew at a steady pace in the Boston and San Francisco Districts, and firms in both Districts indicated an increase in hiring activity. Demand for health-care and professional services was vigorous in the San Francisco District, while demand for professional services in the Dallas District was ""typical.""
Demand for trucking, shipping, and rail services remained strong across the country, but companies cited difficulty finding and retaining drivers in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts. The Boston, Chicago, and Dallas Districts indicated strong demand for air travel.
Reports from the tourism and hospitality industries remained upbeat. Tourism activity strengthened in the Boston, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond Districts and remained solid in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. The Chicago District reported steady tourist activity but noted that pre-bookings were slow. Hotel occupancies were strong in parts of the Atlanta, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, and the Atlanta District reported that gambling revenues were recovering.
Construction and Real Estate
Residential real estate markets continued to cool across much of the country--with most Districts reporting slower homebuilding and sales of existing homes. In contrast, commercial real estate activity continued to strengthen in most Districts. A few reports noted concern about too much building.
Some softening of the market for existing homes was reported by ten Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Dallas and Richmond noted that activity remained quite strong, and Chicago reported slowing from high levels. San Francisco reports hot housing markets in Utah and parts of the Pacific Northwest. Several Districts said sales had weakened for some of the most expensive homes, except in the Dallas District where demand for lower-priced homes ""had dipped noticeably."" Atlanta reported that residential sales were near year-ago levels in most parts of the District, but that sales weakened and inventories increased in Florida. The Philadelphia District said sales of homes in resort areas have declined sharply. The New York District reports a sharp deceleration in prices in the suburbs around New York City, but a tightening of the Manhattan rental markets.
Homebuilding slowed in most Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco. The New York District reported that some homebuilders in New Jersey are withdrawing from the authorization process and allowing their options to build to expire, noting that increases in fuel and materials costs are pinching profits. Homebuilders in the Atlanta District reported that single-family home construction was near year-ago levels in most parts of the District, except in Florida, where sales slowed. The Atlanta District also reported that Florida condominium sales continued to weaken and several projects were cancelled.
Commercial real estate activity strengthened in nearly all Districts, with mostly positive reports about office markets. Commercial building ""improved"" in the Cleveland District. Office markets were steady or stronger in the New York City metro area, with scattered signs of accelerating rents. The Philadelphia District said vacancy rates have continued to decline in the region's office markets. The Richmond District reported ""fairly strong"" office markets. Demand for office space ""edged up at a steady pace"" in the Dallas District. Office vacancy rates fell and rental rates rose in most major markets in the San Francisco District.
Boston reported that downtown office real estate markets were improving but mostly at the expense of suburban markets. Demand for commercial real estate in the Chicago District continued to expand, but the pace of new commercial construction slowed, according to contacts, who said rents were too low to justify new construction.
The Kansas City District reported that commercial construction remained strong, but received a few reports that high material costs were resulting in the scaling down or postponement of some projects. Construction firms in the Philadelphia District reported that rising costs have caused some construction projects to be rebid or redesigned to reduce the amount of costly materials used. Some builders in the San Francisco District continued to face cost increases and minor project delays as a result of tight availability of skilled workers and selected materials, such as steel and cement.
The Philadelphia District reported growing demand for industrial space and an increase in construction of industrial buildings both on a speculative and build-to-suit basis. Demand for industrial properties was said to be gradually improving in the Dallas District. The Richmond District also reported growth in commercial leasing in the industrial sector.
Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, and Dallas Districts expressed concern about the level of investment in some portions of the real estate market. The Boston District reported that New England--and Boston in particular--continues to attract large volumes of commercial real estate investment, resulting in price increases that require ""ambitious assumptions"" to justify the transaction. The Dallas District noted growing concern about overbuilding of condominiums and town homes in Dallas, and contacts ""fear that it will end badly."" A contact in the Chicago District expressed concern about the potential for overbuilding of large distribution centers in Indiana.
Banking and Finance
Overall lending activity was mixed, and credit quality remained good across the nation. The New York, Chicago, and Atlanta Districts reported continued slowing in loan demand, while lending activity levels held steady in the Dallas, Kansas City, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Only the Philadelphia District noted an increase in overall loan volumes over the past six weeks.
Demand for commercial loans increased or remained steady in most Districts, with only the Atlanta and Chicago Districts reporting a slowing in commercial lending activity. Bankers in the Dallas, and Richmond Districts said loan pricing was very competitive, and contacts in the Richmond District said they had to reduce margins to retain market share. On the consumer side, most Districts reported softening mortgage finance activity, while reports of other types of consumer loans were mixed. Demand for home equity loans weakened in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts but was up in the Cleveland and Philadelphia Districts. Refinance activity was categorized as ""brisk"" in the San Francisco District but declined in the Chicago, Kansas City, and New York Districts. Slower auto lending was reported by the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts.
Deposit growth was mostly steady, and some Districts noted an increase in interest rates on deposits. Delinquencies declined in the Chicago and New York Districts, but bankers in the Philadelphia District expect rising default rates if interest rates continue to rise. The Kansas City and St. Louis Districts reported no change in lending standards, while the New York District reported an easing in credit standards, especially for consumer loans.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Agricultural conditions varied across the country. Spring rains boosted moisture conditions in parts of the Dallas and Minneapolis Districts, and most crops were off to a good start in the Chicago, Richmond, and St Louis Districts. Plantings were ahead of last year's pace in the Minneapolis, Richmond, and St Louis Districts, while crop conditions improved in the Atlanta District. In contrast, a dry spell lowered winter wheat crop yields and was hurting cattle producers in parts of the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. Concerns about high fuel and fertilizer costs were reported by contacts in the Kansas City District as well as the Minneapolis District, where agricultural lenders anticipated a decline in farm income in the second quarter.
The energy industry continued to show strong and expanding oil and gas activity in the five Districts that mention the sector--Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. The Dallas and Kansas City Districts noted that drilling activity is being constrained by shortages of equipment and labor. Expansion of coal-fired power plants, wind farms, and ethanol distilleries was reported as under way in the Minneapolis District. The Kansas City District also reported that a railway expansion is in progress that will allow more coal to be moved out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin to end users.
The Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts reported that overall mining activity is strong, with all open mines in the Minneapolis District producing at or near capacity.
Labor Markets
Labor markets continued to tighten across the country. Shortages of some types of skilled workers were reported by nine Districts--Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. Six of those Districts noted that the shortages had intensified--Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Richmond. District reports mention a variety of skills that are in short supply, including truck drivers, some types of engineers, financial analysts, and oil and gas workers. The Minneapolis and New York Districts noted strengthening labor markets. In contrast, manufacturers in the Richmond District reported that hiring softened after several months of moderate payroll increases.
Salaries continued to rise, but wage pressures were reported to have intensified somewhat in only a few Districts--Dallas, Kansas City, and Philadelphia. The San Francisco District said wage growth remained rapid for selected worker groups with specialized skills. The Cleveland District reported an absence of any accumulating wage pressure outside of a few specific skills. Pay rates were not accelerating in the Boston or Chicago Districts.
The Atlanta District reported that shortages of affordable housing were hampering labor availability in South Florida and the Gulf Coast region.
Prices
Concerns about high or rising costs were expressed by business contacts across much of the country. Cost pressures were pushing up selling prices for manufacturers in several Districts, but few reports indicated that these increases were reaching the retail level. Four Districts--Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, and New York--cited rising selling prices for manufacturers, and just three Districts--Boston, Dallas, and Philadelphia--reported that retailers are having success raising retail prices.
Cost pressures increased in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Some firms in the Philadelphia District said their suppliers were including automatic price escalation in contracts to cover future increases in the cost of materials. The San Francisco District noted little or no change from the modest upward pressure on prices noted in the previous report. Only the Richmond District reported that raw materials prices increased less rapidly than in the last report.
Higher prices were reported for a number of items, with the products most cited including fuels, metals, petroleum-based products, and many building materials, such as concrete, steel, copper, and zinc. The most notable price decline was for natural gas. A number of Districts reported increases in fuel surcharges. In the New York District, fuel surcharges were being added with relatively little resistance from customers. Increases in delivery charges were noted by firms in all industries in the Philadelphia District. The Cleveland District reports that rising freight costs were affecting retailers.
Retailers in the Philadelphia District said they have raised retail prices significantly for some goods with large plastic or metal content, although they had not implemented major price increases for most lines of merchandise. Several retailers in the Dallas District said that they had passed cost increases through to higher selling prices. Retailers in the Boston District indicated that vendor prices continued to reflect increases for petroleum-related items, and many contacts reported being able to pass on some price increases to consumers. The Atlanta District reported that firms' ability to pass on higher costs to customers remained mixed, citing slowing demand and strong competition restraining price increases. Five Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco--reported little change in retail prices since the previous reporting period. The Richmond District reported that retail price growth eased slightly in May.",0,1
2006-05-31,"Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity continued to expand in March and the first half of April. Three Districts--Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco--characterize growth as ""solid,"" while a number of others describe the rate of economic activity as ""modest,"" ""moderate,"" or ""steady."" Richmond notes a quicker pace of growth, and Dallas indicates that activity continued to strengthen. By contrast, New York says the rate of growth may have slipped a bit since the last report.
Most Districts report that orders or revenues in the manufacturing sector continue to come in ahead of year-earlier levels, although New York notes some deceleration in manufacturing activity, and Atlanta says that manufacturers' results were mixed. Non-auto retail sales are up from a year ago, as well, according to most Districts, although the shift of Easter from March last year to April this year makes comparisons difficult. Activity levels in service industries--including temporary help, health services, professional and technical services, and transportation and shipping--are also expanding according to District reports. The pace of housing market activity is said to be moderating in many Districts, while commercial activity is firming. A majority of Districts note that labor markets, at least for skilled workers, are tight or are tightening. While energy costs are high and costs for selected other inputs are rising, businesses continue to have limited ability to raise their selling prices.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
The majority of Districts cite improving retail sales overall, but Richmond and Cleveland experienced sluggish or disappointing results. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all report modest to solid gains, although year-over-year comparisons have been complicated by Easter's shift from March in 2005 to April in 2006. Several Districts report strong sales in home and garden products and building goods. Reports on apparel and grocers are mixed. Retail inventories were generally at desired levels across the country.
Auto sales were mixed across the Districts. Many Districts report that sales were short of year-ago levels, but Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Minneapolis all indicate that sales improved from the prior survey period. While demand in San Francisco was stronger than expected, Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas all cite flat sales. Many Districts continue to say that sales of imports and used cars are stronger than new domestic vehicles.
Most of the reports on travel and tourism are positive. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all cite modest to strong improvements, and while New York saw tourism softening slightly, it was still at high levels. In contrast, tourism was mixed in Richmond. Ski resorts in the Boston District continued to suffer from lack of snowfall, but tourism was thriving in the Boston metro area. A record-setting ski season was reported in Virginia, and Minneapolis saw a positive ski season in parts of the District.
Services Industries
All Districts reporting on nonfinancial services note increased activity during the first quarter relative to a year ago. Health-care services expanded in the Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Professional and technical services activity increased according to Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas, while San Francisco notes mixed conditions in information technology services.
Temporary employment firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts report modest demand growth in the first and early second quarters. A large New York employment agency found increased demand for legal and financial services employees, while Dallas contacts noted increased demand for temporary workers in high-tech and light industrial manufacturing.
Transportation services activity improved this quarter, according to reports from the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Trucking and shipping respondents from the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts report increased growth relative to a year ago. While Cleveland's contacts continue to express concern about fuel costs, many now believe that they can increase their base rates, given the strength of demand.
Manufacturing
Reports on manufacturing activity remain positive. Districts describe shipments and orders as continuing to strengthen--significantly in some cases and gradually or steadily in others. Only Atlanta characterizes overall manufacturing activity as mixed, although New York indicates a retrenchment in orders and shipments in early April followed a strong March. All Districts mentioning near-term forecasts say that, on balance, manufacturers expect business to remain on an upward trajectory.
Multiple Districts note strong or expanding production of steel, construction inputs, machine tools, aircraft equipment, and food. Production capacity for mining equipment in the Chicago District is reportedly booked through 2007. Chicago described heavy- and medium-duty truck orders as remaining solid, but light vehicle sales as flat, with some signs of excess auto inventories. Other District updates on auto assembly and parts production were mixed--some up and others down. Trends in apparel-making also varied, with Richmond and Dallas citing increases but Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco indicating shutdowns or disappointments.
Although several Districts describe labor demand in the manufacturing sector as mixed, most report some form of pickup. For example, Richmond says that ""factory employment grew modestly,"" Cleveland notes more hiring on the part of durable goods producers, and Boston indicates that most manufacturers were hiring in order to obtain a ""higher skill mix."" District reports on capital spending tend to be either modestly positive or mixed.

Real Estate and Construction
Most Districts report cooling and moderation in their residential real estate markets. In general, year-on-year price appreciation seems to be lower than in quarters past, with San Francisco, Cleveland, Kansas City, Richmond, New York, and Boston all reporting more modest price growth in residential sales. Several Districts' contacts noted that slower price increases were a healthy market outcome. Residential inventories are increasing; Kansas City, Minneapolis, Chicago, Atlanta, New York and Boston all saw increases in residential inventories compared with the first quarter of last year. The Dallas District, by contrast, registered particularly strong residential sales.
Residential construction is more regionally differentiated than overall residential sales and prices. In the West, Dallas and San Francisco both cite high levels of residential construction activity, with Dallas homebuilders reaching record sales for the first quarter of 2006. In the Midwest, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis report declining residential construction. As well, the Chicago District mentions slower residential building in most areas. In the South, Atlanta indicates that single family construction remained strong but that some condominium projects have been postponed or cancelled.
The commercial real estate outlook appears to be predominantly positive across the reporting Districts--none report weakening commercial demand. San Francisco, Dallas, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Atlanta, and New York all register strong commercial activity. Kansas City, Chicago, and Richmond report steady to improving levels of activity. With vacancies declining in many locations, rents appear to be edging upwards.
In the West and the Midwest, commercial construction appears to be responding to increased commercial demand. Dallas, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Chicago, and St. Louis all report increasing or soon-to-be increasing commercial construction. San Francisco cites continued high levels of construction activity. In the South, Richmond reports little change in new construction, while overall development in Atlanta remained at low levels. The New York District featured relatively stable commercial construction.
Banking and Finance
Reports of lending activity are mixed, as most Districts reporting on financial services continue to see decreases in demand for consumer loans and residential mortgages, coupled with moderate expansion of commercial and industrial lending. St. Louis and Kansas City, in particular, saw a decrease in consumer lending, while both Chicago and Kansas City witnessed decreased demand for home equity loans. Almost all Districts report declining demand for residential mortgages. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial lending increased in nearly all Districts, with only St. Louis reporting a decline. Bankers in Richmond noted that commercial lending for mergers and acquisitions and construction remained high. Respondents in San Francisco mentioned an increase in venture capital financing.
While reports of credit quality are positive across the board, delinquency reports are more varied, with low delinquency rates in Atlanta, commercial and industrial delinquency rates increasing slightly in New York, home mortgage delinquency rates increasing somewhat in Dallas, and respondents in Philadelphia predicting a possible future increase in delinquencies due to rising interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages. Deposit growth was steady in Cleveland and Kansas City, sluggish in Chicago, and flat in Dallas. Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco all report fierce competition for loans and narrow net interest margins. However, credit standards remained virtually unchanged in all Districts except for New York, where standards tightened slightly for consumer loans.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Adverse weather conditions and high energy costs are affecting agricultural prospects in much of the country. Although recent rains have brought some relief, dry weather has reportedly stressed pastureland and crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. By contrast, unusually wet weather has delayed fieldwork in the San Francisco District. Ranchers facing poor pasturage in Kansas City and Dallas are culling their herds and giving supplemental feed unusually early; as a result, Kansas City reports downward pressure on prices for feedlot cattle. In San Francisco, prices received by ranchers have softened but remain at a high level. St. Louis and Minneapolis report that one-half to two-thirds of the winter wheat crop is in good to excellent condition, but the Kansas City crop is described as poor, and Dallas reports that half the District wheat crop will be lost. Reflecting relative crop prices and the high cost of fertilizer, Chicago and St. Louis farmers are said to be shifting acreage from corn to soybeans. Contacts in Dallas and San Francisco also note the high cost of fertilizer and fuel, while Chicago and Dallas indicate that these costs are combining with dry conditions to cause cash flow problems for farmers.
In the energy sector, demand for oil and natural gas or oil services remains robust and energy activity continues to expand, according to contacts in the Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis reports that energy activity is stable at a high level. Dallas and Kansas City indicate that the count of active oil and gas rigs continues to rise. In the Gulf of Mexico, Dallas notes that the rig count is close to pre-Katrina levels, while Atlanta reports that the share of oil and gas still ""shut in"" amounted to just 23 percent for oil and 14 percent for natural gas in early April. Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco contacts see little or no excess capacity in the energy sector. In particular, Kansas City contacts say that shortages of equipment and workers are constraining drilling activity; pipeline capacity is also limited in some areas. In the Minneapolis District, almost all open mines are producing near capacity.
Prices and Wages
High energy prices were at the forefront of most Districts' mentions of cost pressures. Manufacturers in most Districts cite rising costs for other inputs, with metals mentioned most frequently along with petroleum-related products. While no District reports that cost increases have intensified in the latest survey period, Kansas City says that firms were having greater difficulty obtaining steel and aluminum. Services firms are also reported to be facing higher costs, notably for utilities, shipping, and transportation. Many Districts describe firms as attempting to raise selling prices but having mixed success, with price increases generally either smaller than the cost increases or less widespread. Richmond, Cleveland, and Chicago, for example, mention manufacturing firms' limited ability to recoup higher costs; Boston and Dallas say competitive pressures are constraining some price increases, and Atlanta notes that the ability to pass on cost increases varies across firms, depending in part on the strength of demand and contract arrangements. Construction materials costs have also risen, or supplies are tight, according to reports from Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas.
A number of Districts, including Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, cite high energy prices as an explanation for weaker than expected tourism results, auto sales, or retail sales, especially to lower-income consumers, with the impact occurring both directly by constraining consumers' driving and indirectly by reducing the income available for purchases after paying for home fuel and transportation fuel. Atlanta and Chicago note the possibility of such energy cost impacts as a risk to the summer outlook.
District reports from Boston, New York, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas say that labor markets are tightening, especially for skilled positions. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Atlanta indicate that labor markets remain tight in at least some parts of their Districts. Contacts in Atlanta, Richmond, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas state that truck drivers are in short supply. Wages continue to move up, but only a few Districts--New York, Dallas, and Kansas City--mention a pickup in the pace of raises, while Philadelphia cites firms more often paying in the high end of salary ranges. Richmond reports no pickup, but a continuation of ""brisk"" wage increases in services. Boston says manufacturing wage increases are in the same range as last year, Chicago cites a steady pace of labor cost increases, and Cleveland notes no reports of accumulating wage pressure, while Minneapolis and San Francisco mention moderate overall wage increases.",1,0
2006-04-30,"Economic activity continued to expand in January and February, according to reports from the twelve Federal Reserve District Banks. Most Districts characterized the pace of expansion as moderate or steady. San Francisco said that the ""solid expansion remained on track,"" and Dallas indicated that activity strengthened. In contrast, the pace of growth moderated in the Richmond District, and Philadelphia said activity expanded at a slow pace.
Nationwide, consumer spending continued to expand. Capital spending increased at a similar pace as in the previous reporting period, and expenditures for business services continued to rise. Employment continued to increase in most locations and in many sectors of the economy. Most Districts said that residential construction and real estate activity slowed from high levels, while commercial markets were generally more active than at the end of 2005. Reports indicated that manufacturing continued to expand during the first two months of the year. Household lending softened, while commercial and industrial lending expanded at a modest pace. Contacts noted ongoing input cost pressures, but prices at the retail level increased at only a moderate rate. Labor cost pressures were little changed. Natural resource activity was very solid overall. Agricultural conditions remained mixed, and a continued lack of moisture generated concern in several Districts.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Consumer spending continued to expand. Many Districts reported that retail sales showed solid gains during January, which retailers frequently said were spurred in part by unseasonably warm weather and holiday gift card redemptions. Without the added boost from those factors, retail sales during February softened in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas regions. However, sales in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts apparently maintained much of their momentum. Retail inventories were generally at desired levels across the country. Light vehicle sales in many areas were described as ""sluggish"" or ""unusually slow,"" although Philadelphia and Atlanta noted some improvement in sales between January and February. Vehicle inventories were generally above desired levels.
The majority of reports on tourism were positive. Sales were up over last year at winter-sports destinations in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City regions; however, ski resorts in New England and New Mexico were suffering from a lack of snowfall. Warm-weather destinations in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts reported a brisk pace of activity. Atlanta also noted that tourism in the Gulf Coast region was being re-established slowly, though several casinos experienced larger-than-expected increases in revenues.
Business Spending and Hiring
Most reports indicated that capital spending increased at a similar pace as in the previous reporting period. There were some exceptions. Manufacturers in Philadelphia reported a pickup in the pace of investment, and firms related to the heavy equipment industry said that they were budgeting large expansions in capital outlays. In contrast, manufacturers in Atlanta had modest near-term spending plans, and those in Kansas City indicated that they were slowing the rate of increase in their capital spending. In the San Francisco District, the implementation of productivity-enhancing technologies has allowed banks to maintain profit margins and helped producers in the agricultural and resource sectors maintain output levels in the face of input constraints.
Expenditures for most business services continued to rise. Several Districts noted strong revenue gains for insurance, accounting, telecommunications, and health care firms. Boston said that information technology services firms reported strong revenue growth and expectations for steady or faster growth in the next six months. Demand for trucking and rail shipping services remained robust in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas; two of those Districts observed tight capacity conditions. Air travel was strong in many parts of the country.
Employment continued to increase in most locations and in many sectors of the economy. Atlanta said labor markets were firm, and Minneapolis saw signs of tightening. Cleveland said job openings had increased but hiring remained sluggish. Kansas City indicated that layoff notices outnumbered hiring announcements. Retail employment was steady in recent weeks, according to Boston, Richmond, and Chicago. New York observed a pickup in manufacturing hiring, but factory employment was steady or showed more limited increases in other regions. Three Districts reported an expansion in service jobs. Demand for temporary workers was strong in most areas, although several staffing firms in the Boston region said that revenues have been lower than expected recently. Almost every District reported shortages of high-skilled workers.
Construction and Real Estate
Construction and real estate activity was mixed by market segment and location. Most Districts said that residential activity slowed from high levels. Homebuilders in many Districts indicated that new home sales were trending down, but contacts in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas regions said that demand for new homes had improved relative to the end of 2005. Half of the Districts reported that the number of homes for sale had increased. Home price appreciation slowed in many areas, and real estate agents in the Richmond region said that fewer homesellers were receiving multiple offers. Several developers in the Atlanta District reported putting condominium projects on hold because of soft pre-sales or rising construction costs.
In contrast, commercial construction and real estate markets were generally more active than at the end of 2005. Philadelphia reported that the completion of a number of office projects this year would boost the space on the market; Minneapolis noted a number of new development projects; and San Francisco said that building activity had picked up for commercial projects and public structures. Chicago and Richmond indicated that overall commercial vacancy rates were stable. Office vacancy rates fell in the Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco regions, but were mixed in New York. Industrial vacancy rates fell in three Districts, and Philadelphia said that demand for factory space had increased.
Manufacturing
District reports indicated that manufacturing activity continued to expand during January and February. Atlanta and Dallas said that activity picked up, and New York noted continued improvement in conditions, while Kansas City and San Francisco suggested that the pace of expansion had slowed; the remaining Districts indicated that manufacturing conditions were similar to those at the end of 2005. Manufacturers in Boston and Philadelphia generally expected the expansion in activity to continue in the coming months, and factories in Cleveland anticipated a pickup.
In most Districts, the strength in demand for factory goods was widespread across industries. The sectors frequently mentioned as facing strong demand included construction materials, electrical equipment, defense products, tractor trailers, heavy trucks, and heavy machinery. Cleveland reported that steel shipments held steady or increased, and Chicago said that steel production remained strong. Conditions in other metals industries were mixed, as Philadelphia and Chicago reported strong growth in demand, Dallas noted little change, and San Francisco characterized demand as ""tepid."" Most regions had some weak performing industries, but few were consistently mentioned as underperforming. Several Districts commented on the ongoing struggles of the domestic nameplates in the auto industry. An automaker in the Chicago region reported that slowing sales and high inventories would likely restrain production in the coming months, and automakers in Cleveland noted large declines in output compared to year-ago levels. Atlanta mentioned that many suppliers to the domestic nameplates have seen slower demand, and Kansas City added that a number of partsmakers had ceased production. Dallas noted that a narrowing spread between refined fuel and crude prices led some refineries to briefly reduce production in February. Some refineries in the Gulf Coast region reportedly will have longer maintenance turnaround times this spring because repairs were postponed in the aftermath of the hurricanes last fall.
Banking and Finance
Household lending activity softened, while commercial and industrial lending expanded at a modest pace. Reports on mortgage demand ranged from slowing growth in Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco to declining activity in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City. Other types of consumer borrowing were typically characterized as ""mixed"" or ""weak."" Interest rates on household loans increased in most Districts.
Business lending increased at a slow pace in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco regions, while it was unchanged in the New York and St. Louis Districts. Bankers in Philadelphia expected growth in commercial and industrial lending, although several indicated that they were limiting real estate development and construction loans. Interest rates on commercial loans increased, according to New York, Richmond, and Kansas City.
Comments about household and business credit quality were mostly favorable. Delinquencies were unchanged in New York and remained low in Atlanta, though a banker in the Chicago region said that there was a noticeable rise in delinquencies and foreclosures in parts of Michigan dominated by the auto industry. Deposit growth was generally steady, and several Districts indicated that interest rates on deposits had increased. Lending was very competitive, which squeezed margins for many banks. Nonetheless, no District reported a change in lending standards.
Prices and Employment Costs
Contacts generally reported ongoing input cost pressures, while prices at the retail level increased at only a moderate rate. Philadelphia observed a steady rate of increase in input costs, and Chicago said that cost pressures remained firm. Cleveland said that cost pressures were less pronounced than in the previous reporting period, but Richmond said that the prices of most intermediate goods and services were increasing at a somewhat faster pace. San Francisco saw little or no change in modest inflation pressures. At the retail level, Kansas City said price pressures edged up, but Atlanta saw only moderate price increases for non-energy consumer prices, and New York noted little broad-based acceleration in consumer prices.
Elevated energy costs were mentioned frequently. Fuel surcharges remained in place in many locations. Contacts in Atlanta felt that a high degree of uncertainty in the energy markets would cause many firms to leave surcharges in place for the indefinite future, but some large companies in the Chicago region obtained a few reductions. The costs of many non-petroleum materials--including asphalt, cement, gypsum, lumber, copper, and paper--were on the rise, though steel prices stabilized in most places. Airfares and hotel room rates continued to increase.
Labor cost pressures were little changed. Most Districts reported that wages increased modestly on average. The only exception was Philadelphia, which reported that many of its contacts expected a faster rate of increase in average salaries and wages compared with 2005, as firms stepped up counteroffers to workers who were planning to change jobs. A shortage of qualified workers for skilled positions in finance, construction, and manufacturing industries resulted in more rapid increases in pay for those workers.
Energy and Natural Resources
Natural resource activity was very solid overall. Energy extraction improved in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco regions and remained at a high level in Minneapolis. Most of these Districts reported that output was constrained by shortages of labor, parts, and equipment. Oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remained in a slow recovery from last year's hurricanes. Mining activity increased in the Minneapolis District, where several mines were running at or near full capacity.
Agriculture
Agricultural conditions varied across the nation. Unseasonably mild weather boosted output in the San Francisco District and aided field preparations in Richmond and Chicago. Moisture conditions improved in much of the Minneapolis region, but a continued lack of moisture affected farmers and ranchers in the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. The drought concerns limited cattle herd expansion, and some banking contacts in the Dallas region said that they may not finance certain farming operations unless moisture conditions improved. Prices for agricultural products remained generally stable or increased, though poultry prices declined. Agricultural input costs were still high, which limited purchases of fertilizers, chemicals, and machinery.",1,1
2006-02-28,"Economic expansion continued across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts through the last several weeks of 2005. Six--New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City--characterized their economies as expanding moderately or modestly. Activity accelerated or increased at a solid pace in the San Francisco, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts. Boston characterized activity as continuing to expand, while Cleveland reported that conditions remained reasonably strong.
Most Districts reported moderate increases in employment. Labor markets tightened in some areas and for some occupations, but on the whole, wage increases were characterized as moderate. Contacts reported that input-price pressures have continued for many items, particularly early in the supply chain, but they were less intense at year-end than earlier. Retail prices and producers' prices for more finished goods, however, were widely reported as rising only moderately or remaining stable.
Retail sales rose in most Districts, and those Districts that reported on travel and tourism spending said it was generally strong. Increases in manufacturing activity were widely reported. Most Districts indicated some cooling in residential real estate activity, while many noted that commercial real estate activity generally continued to improve. Consumer borrowing was flat or fell in most Districts, while commercial borrowing was more mixed, with many Districts reporting moderate increases in activity. Conditions in the energy sector seemed strong, while agricultural activity was mixed.
Prices
Several Districts (San Francisco, Kansas City, Chicago, Richmond, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Boston) reported that increases in energy prices moderated, or actually fell, albeit from high levels. In the San Francisco, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts, these developments were thought to be associated with a wider easing in overall price pressures. However, in the remaining nine Districts, nonlabor-input-cost increases continued to concern companies, particularly those in the manufacturing sector. Producers were reported to have attempted to recoup these costs, although, according to the Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco, and Dallas Districts, intense competition was thought to be holding down price increases in parts of the supply chain further ""downstream."" Increases in the prices of construction materials were widely reported.
Retail prices were generally regarded as stable, though there was some significant discounting reported in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts during the holiday selling season. More moderate discounting was reported in the Dallas District, levels about the same as last year were reported in the San Francisco District, and no widespread discounting was reported in the Philadelphia District. Price increases are planned in the months ahead by a large share of retailers, according to the Kansas City District.
Employment and Wages
Most Districts reported signs of continued, if generally moderate, increases in employment. Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Richmond all cited moderate employment gains, with Richmond noting that its rate represented a slowdown. New York, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported evidence of stronger employment growth. However, Boston noted that output growth had generally not translated into higher employment, while St. Louis reported a widely mixed pattern of layoffs and hiring. Hiring at financial and legal services firms is boosting the New York District's employment growth, although New York also reported some hiring in manufacturing. Atlanta reported strong demand for both skilled and unskilled labor, in part boosted by storm-recovery efforts.
Atlanta reported several locations with tight labor market conditions, while Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported specific occupations in which jobs have been difficult to fill. Several of these Districts cited trucking jobs. Skilled construction workers are relatively sought after in Dallas and San Francisco, and skilled manufacturing jobs were mentioned by Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Atlanta listed a variety of specialties in ""extreme shortage."" New York and San Francisco noted that finance-industry labor markets were relatively tight. Despite reports of labor market tightness, Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all noted that wage increases have been generally moderate. However, New York, Chicago, and Dallas all reported some acceleration in compensation.
Consumer Spending
All Districts reported that their retail sales rose during this latest holiday selling season except Cleveland, where sales were generally flat or less than at this time a year ago. Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported modest to moderate increases. Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reported stronger holiday sales than these Districts. The Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts noted significant increases in gift card sales, which led retailers in Richmond and Dallas to anticipate stronger sales and profits in early 2006. Most merchants appear to have carefully controlled their inventories, which are generally at desired levels.
Automobile sales were generally somewhat sluggish across the nation. Dealers fared best in the Richmond, San Francisco, and Dallas Districts, where sales improved from low levels. Sales trends were somewhat more mixed in the Chicago and Atlanta Districts. Atlanta and Philadelphia reported that sales remained strong for foreign brands, even as demand waned for domestic ones, sales of which were reportedly not helped much by manufacturers' promotions. Philadelphia and Kansas City characterized truck and SUV sales as especially slow.
Travel and Tourism
Travel and tourism remained robust across most of the country. The San Francisco District reported that travel and tourism spending in Hawaii toward the end of the year occurred at a record-setting pace. Elsewhere, ski resorts throughout the Kansas City and Minnesota Districts have done well this winter, though a few areas have suffered from a lack of snow. In the Southeast, the Atlanta and Richmond Districts also reported robust activity, some of which was thought to be the result of unusually warm weather. Tourist activity appeared to be recovering somewhat in hurricane-affected areas. Finally, in the Northeast, travel and tourism remained strong.
Manufacturing 
Increases in manufacturing activity were widely reported across the country. Only the St. Louis District characterized industrial activity as mixed. Elsewhere, robust expansion was reported in the San Francisco, Dallas, Kansas City, Minnesota, Chicago, New York, and Boston Districts. More moderate expansion was indicated in the Cleveland, Richmond, Philadelphia, and Atlanta Districts.
Production of high-technology goods was steady to slightly increasing toward the end of 2005, according to the San Francisco and Dallas Districts. And defense and aerospace industry production improved in the San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta Districts. Manufacturers of machine tools and industrial equipment also reported more robust demand in the San Francisco, Chicago, and Philadelphia Districts. Production of construction-related materials and equipment expanded noticeably in the San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts but was characterized as slightly less strong in the Boston District. Primary metals producers reported strong demand in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Producers of plastics and petrochemicals noted some slowing in demand in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, though this was from fairly high levels. By contrast, reports from the Richmond and St. Louis Districts suggested some improvement in the sector. And weakness in the textile industry was reported in the Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts.
In the transportation equipment sector, reports from the Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta Districts suggested weakness among automakers and their suppliers. However, in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, activity appeared to be somewhat stronger. Heavy truck production was also characterized as improving in the Chicago District. Conditions in the transportation equipment sector were more mixed in the St. Louis District.
Trucking and Shipping
Trucking and shipping demand remained strong across the country, but companies were constrained by continuing driver shortages in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, and Philadelphia Districts. In addition, despite the ongoing use of fuel surcharges, contacts in Cleveland, Dallas, and Atlanta noted that margins tightened because of fuel-cost increases. Cleveland and Dallas reported plans for increased capital spending in the trucking industry. Dallas also reported that both railroads and airlines saw rising demand.
Construction and Real Estate
Many Districts reported moderation in residential real estate activity, although from a high level. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported some cooling in real estate markets. While some of the hottest markets in the San Francisco District have cooled--for example, Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area--other areas, such as Oregon and especially Hawaii, have reportedly heated up further. Kansas City and Dallas continued to see strong housing markets. And construction and repair work remained brisk in Louisiana and Mississippi.
Conditions in Districts' commercial real estate markets generally continued to improve. Vacancy rates fell in the San Francisco, Minneapolis, New York, Dallas, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts. Chicago reported a more mixed picture, with some areas of the District expanding but activity in the city of Chicago flat. Largely because of lower vacancy rates, rents rose in San Francisco and New York, while previous concessions were reduced or eliminated in Dallas. New construction activity was reported to be increasing in the San Francisco, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Cleveland Districts, and many contacts expect this trend to continue in 2006.
Banking and Finance
The Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis Districts saw moderate increases in commercial lending activity, while Chicago and Richmond reported that activity had slowed and Atlanta reported that activity was mixed. Consumer lending was flat or fell slightly in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. The Philadelphia District was an exception, noting gains in consumer and residential real estate loans, but contacts noted that they expected lending for residential real estate to experience modest declines in the future. In the Dallas District, deposit growth was strong, while Cleveland, Kansas City, and St. Louis reported modest increases in total deposits. New York reported that conditions in the securities industry remained robust, with employees receiving significant increases in bonuses this year.
Energy and Natural Resources 
Conditions in the energy sector were characterized as strong or stable at a high level by four of the five Districts reporting on natural resources. As a result, San Francisco, Dallas, and Kansas City all reported shortages of labor, materials, and equipment among energy-related enterprises. Producers of natural gas and oil reportedly operated near 100 percent capacity in the San Francisco District, while the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported that facilities in the Gulf of Mexico continued to recover from hurricane-related damage. Minneapolis reported that most mining operations in its District were running near capacity.
Agriculture
Dallas, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago all reported that low levels of precipitation were affecting crops and have the potential to lower yields in the spring, while Richmond reported that cold weather and abundant precipitation slowed harvesting activity in November and December. Citrus producers in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported a boost in profits from an increase in prices in the wake of substantial hurricane damage to the citrus crop in Florida. Livestock reports were mixed, with San Francisco reporting increases in sales, Chicago reporting rising cattle prices and stable hog prices, and Dallas and Kansas City reporting reductions or anticipated reductions in herd sizes.",1,1
2005-11-30,"Economic activity continued to expand in September, according to information received by Federal Reserve District Banks. Most Districts described the pace of activity as moderate or gradual. Richmond reported some quickening in the pace of growth while New York reported a slowdown. Atlanta reported mixed economic conditions, with significant negative effects on the District economy from hurricane damage. Dallas reported expansion overall but also experienced noticeable disruptions to the District economy as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Retail sales of general merchandise increased in most Districts, but a number of Banks reported that retail sales were either below plan or weak. Auto sales fell throughout the Districts. Tourism activity was mixed. Service sector activity continued to expand. Manufacturing advanced in all Districts except St. Louis and Atlanta. Commercial real estate markets continued to firm up. Residential real estate activity remained generally strong, but reports that demand for homes has eased have become somewhat more common. Agricultural conditions were viewed as mostly good. Mining and energy production increased except in the Gulf of Mexico, where damage to onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities is still being repaired. Bank loans and deposits rose.
Employment has been rising, and Federal Reserve Districts reported some tightening in labor markets. Wage increases have been moderate, although a number of Districts noted increased upward pressure on wages and salaries in the service sectors and for some skilled occupations in several industries. All Districts reported cost increases for energy, petroleum-based products, building materials, and shipping. Several Districts indicated that input cost increases are being passed through to retail prices.
Consumer Spending
Retail sales of general merchandise rose moderately in most of the Federal Reserve Districts in September, but other Districts reported some softness in the retail sector. Sales increased in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Atlanta District retailers also had increased sales except in areas where hurricane damage forced stores to close. Retailers in New York and St. Louis reported that sales in September had not met their plans, and retail sales in San Francisco were said to have weakened somewhat. Retailers in many Districts noted that consumer confidence has ebbed as gasoline prices have risen.
Auto sales fell in the Districts that received reports from auto dealers. The drop came as manufacturers ended their discount programs. Sales of light trucks and large sport utility vehicles were reported to have declined sharply. However, within the generally slower sales environment, Atlanta and Dallas reported that sales of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and hybrid vehicles were strong.
Reports on tourism and leisure travel were mixed. New York, Chicago, and San Francisco reported ongoing gains in tourism business and high rates of hotel occupancy. Richmond and Minneapolis reported slower tourism activity, although Minneapolis indicated an increase in business travel was boosting hotel occupancy. Tourism in Kansas City was said to be largely unchanged after a period of strong expansion. Tourism activity declined in Richmond, and fell in Atlanta as a result of hurricane damage in New Orleans and along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
Services
Service activity expanded in almost all the Districts that reported on this sector. Health-care services expanded in Boston, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Professional and technical service business increased in Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas. Philadelphia reported gains in business services and information technology services. Transportation activity was strong, according to New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Atlanta gave a mixed report on transportation: demand for shipping was said to be strong, but damage to port facilities and railroads was severely limiting capacity.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity rose in all Federal Reserve Districts except St. Louis, where manufacturers gave mixed reports, and Atlanta, where manufacturers along the Gulf Coast are still recovering from hurricane damage. There were noticeable increases in demand for food products in Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco, but St. Louis reported decreased demand at food processors there. Increased demand for industrial equipment was noted by Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Boston and St. Louis reported increased demand for pharmaceuticals. Richmond's producers saw increased demand for chemicals and a variety of durable goods. Cleveland and Kansas City also reported increased demand for durable goods generally.

All the Districts reporting on commercial real estate conditions noted rising demand for office, retail, or industrial space. Increased demand for commercial space was reported by New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Cleveland and Richmond cited growing construction of commercial buildings. Atlanta reported a surge in demand for commercial space in areas where firms relocated after the hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast.

Office vacancy rates were declining in New York, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas. San Francisco reported rising commercial rental rates. Chicago indicated that rents rose in areas other than downtown Chicago. Dallas reported that rents were holding firm but landlords were reducing incentives.
District banks gave mixed reports on residential real estate markets.

Minneapolis reported that home sales had slowed in some areas but were strong in others. Boston reported that homes were taking longer to sell, as did New York. Cleveland reported little growth in residential construction. Kansas City reported some easing in home sales and a growing inventory of houses for sale. Chicago also reported higher inventories of unsold homes on the market. Atlanta reported a strong increase in demand for housing in areas where evacuees from the coast were relocating, but indicated that demand for homes was moderating elsewhere in the District.
Agriculture
Agricultural conditions have been mostly good, but not uniformly so around the country. Atlanta received mostly positive crop and livestock reports, although the storms damaged at least half of the Louisiana sugarcane crop. Chicago reported that corn and soybean yields have been greater than expected. Crop yields in Minneapolis were up for most crops. Kansas City reported favorable harvest conditions and good progress in winter wheat planting. Less positive reports came from St. Louis, where the rain brought by the hurricanes damaged corn, rice, and cotton crops. Dallas reported that hot, dry weather in parts of the District has stressed crops, although cotton yields were high. Richmond reported that hot, dry conditions were hindering fall planting of winter wheat, rye, oats, and barley. Kansas City said that the transportation difficulties associated with the hurricanes hampered crop exports. Chicago also reported that transportation of grains was disrupted, and farmers were unable to obtain adequate storage space; As a result, crops were left in the fields or sold at lowered prices.
Natural Resources Industries
Districts reporting on the energy sector noted strong demand in the midst of supply constraints. The limits on supply are a result of hurricane damage to oil and gas production and refining facilities along the Gulf Coast and to shortages of drilling equipment and oilfield workers elsewhere. Atlanta reported that production in the Gulf remained severely disrupted, and that safety inspections and repair work continued. Kansas City saw an increase in the rig count, but indicated activity could have expanded further if more equipment and workers were available. Dallas also reported increased activity, but noted that the loss of rigs in the Gulf had cut oil and gas production, and that damage to staging areas on the coast was retarding the repair effort. San Francisco reported that producers of natural gas in that District were operating at or near full capacity. Minneapolis reported that mining and energy activity was steady at a high level.
Financial Services and Credit
Lending rose in most Federal Reserve Districts in September. Commercial and industrial lending advanced in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Commercial and industrial loan demand was reported to be steady in New York and St. Louis, but business borrowing slowed in Cleveland. New York noted decreased demand for consumer loans and residential mortgages. Chicago and Kansas City reported an easing in demand for residential mortgages, but St. Louis reported gains. Dallas and San Francisco noted growth in lending in general. St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported growth in deposits. In the Atlanta District, small banks in areas devastated by the hurricanes are concerned that they will not retain their customer base if their market areas do not regain their resident populations. Competition for loans was reported to be very intense in most regions.
Employment and Wages
Federal Reserve Districts reporting on employment noted tightening in labor market conditions. Increased hiring was noted in a variety of industries. Boston reported increased demand for professional and technical service workers. New York cited stepped up hiring of office workers, especially in the financial industry. Increased hiring in the financial sector was also reported by Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Philadelphia and Cleveland noted that trucking firms in their Districts were having difficulty attracting and retaining drivers. Dallas also indicated strong demand for truck drivers. Chicago reported increases in hiring at firms in the software and telecommunications industry and among chemical companies, but noted layoffs among manufacturers of motor vehicles, paper products, and communications equipment. St. Louis reported increased hiring in the lodging industry and the health care sector. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported hiring in the mining industry, and Kansas City and Dallas reported increased hiring in the energy industry. Richmond and Chicago noted an upturn in hiring at temporary staffing companies.
Atlanta reported significant problems resulting from dislocation of workers caused by the hurricanes. Temporary help agencies have been active in recruiting workers for disaster relief and cleanup operations. In locations outside the areas damaged by the hurricanes, employment centers have been established, and job fairs have been held to assist displaced workers find jobs. However, employers in the Dallas District have looked to evacuees to bring needed skills to the District labor pool.
Most of the Districts reporting on wages said recent increases have been moderate, and Kansas City indicated that wage pressures have edged down. However, Richmond noted that wages in the service sector have been increasing briskly, and San Francisco reported that wage pressures have risen noticeably for skilled workers in finance, construction, information technology, resource extraction, and health care. Employers in the Philadelphia District said their benefit costs have been rising steeply. San Francisco reported that employers there said their benefit costs have been rising faster than wages, but not as rapidly as in previous survey periods.
Prices
All Federal Reserve Districts reported a pickup in cost pressures from recent increases in the prices of energy, petroleum-based products, and shipping. Reports of price increases for building materials, such as cement, sheetrock, and lumber, were also widespread. These price increases have come largely in the wake of the recent hurricanes, as the supply of oil and natural gas has been disrupted and repair and rebuilding have increased the demand for construction materials. Nevertheless, many business firms indicated to the District Banks that they expect high prices for energy and construction materials to persist. In addition, New York and Kansas City reported a general escalation of costs for manufacturing inputs.
While a number of Districts noted increases in prices of final goods, others continued to report that those prices remain relatively stable. Chicago cited price increases for pharmaceuticals and air travel. In Richmond and Atlanta, retailers and other business firms reported passing their cost increases through into their selling prices, and in Philadelphia and Dallas, large numbers of business firms said they have raised, or plan to raise their prices. However, San Francisco reported that prices of final goods have remained stable, and Boston and Chicago said that the ability of businesses in their Districts to raise prices downstream was limited.

Commercial real estate activity was described as strong in the Richmond District and as improving in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Dallas reported that speculative office construction increased, apartment construction remained high, and hotel markets were hot. Some of the increased real estate demand in the Dallas District was attributed to outside investors attracted by the area's lower real estate prices.
Banking and Finance
In Districts reporting on banking conditions, loan demand increased or remained solid. Overall lending increased in most Districts, with growth ranging from slight in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts to solid in the Dallas District. Atlanta and San Francisco both characterized loan demand as strong. In most Districts, loan growth was attributed to increases in home mortgages, home equity loans, or business loans. Credit quality was generally strong, although there were some concerns about loans to auto suppliers and farmers in the Chicago District and loans for Florida condominium developments in the Atlanta District. Dallas indicated that competition for large commercial loans had intensified, and Chicago said that competitive pressures had led to some easing of commercial credit standards. Outside of the banking sector, cash inflows to investment companies increased in the Philadelphia District, and venture capital rose for the first time in five years in the Chicago District. New York and Richmond also reported increased activity in the financial services sector as a whole.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Although conditions remained favorable in most agricultural Districts, dry weather was a problem in some areas. Richmond reported that substantial rainfall brought on by two tropical storms generally improved soil conditions in the District. Atlanta reported only limited damage to crops from the storms and favorable crop conditions overall, although citrus canker continues to be of some concern in Florida. Kansas City and Minneapolis also said that crop conditions were mostly favorable, and winter wheat yields were above year-ago levels in both Districts. Some Kansas City contacts reported concern about higher energy prices boosting irrigation costs. Drought conditions were reported in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts, and Chicago noted these conditions had led to an increase in corn and soybean prices. The lack of rain caused pasture conditions to deteriorate substantially in the St. Louis and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reported little or no impact on cattle prices from renewed fears about mad cow disease, while Kansas City reported that the resumption of live cattle imports from Canada was contributing to downward pressure on cattle prices.
Activity in the energy industry remained strong. Oil and gas activity increased in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts and remained steady in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. Kansas City reported that drilling was constrained due to a shortage of available rigs and regulatory factors, and some oil service firms in the Dallas District were turning down available work due to limited capacity. Dallas contacts also noted difficulty finding qualified engineers and training crews. Atlanta reported a temporary shut-in of some oil and natural gas supplies in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Dennis. Minneapolis respondents said that mines are operating at full capacity, with exploration activity in full swing across the District.
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
The demand for labor continued to increase in most Districts, although hiring in several Districts was mixed. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all noted an overall firming in labor markets. Boston reported moderate increases in services employment and mostly steady employment in retail and manufacturing. In the Richmond District, jobs increased moderately at services firms but declined slightly at manufacturing firms. New York said labor markets were a bit softer overall despite a pickup in hiring in financial services. Several Districts reported increased demand for temporary workers, while no Districts reported weaker demand for temps. Skilled workers were said to be in shorter supply in several Districts, and truck drivers were reported as scarce in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts.
Despite generally tighter labor markets, nearly all Districts said overall wage pressures remained moderate. The only wage pressures cited by the Dallas District were in the accounting and energy industries, and Chicago said the only sizable wage gains were in some skilled professions experiencing labor shortages. San Francisco also reported only modest overall wage growth but noted an increasing use of incentive compensation by some employers to attract workers. Rising health-care costs continued to be a concern for contacts in the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts, but Chicago reported that one large health insurance firm plans to implement the smallest premium increase in a decade.
Overall price pressures either eased slightly or remained unchanged in most Districts, despite substantial increases in the costs of energy and some building materials. Manufacturers in the New York District reported a marked deceleration in input prices and expect substantially less upward price pressure in coming months. Some moderation in input price increases was also noted in the Richmond, Kansas City, and Cleveland Districts. Overall cost and price pressures were described as mild in the Richmond District, moderate in the Chicago District, and largely unchanged from the second quarter in the Philadelphia District. Kansas City and Minneapolis noted some softening in the costs of steel. However, many Districts reported substantial increases in the costs of energy, petroleum-based products, and building materials such as concrete and plywood. Chicago, Cleveland, and Dallas said that transportation firms were able to pass on much of their increased fuel costs to customers. However, in a number of Districts, firms outside the transportation sector were reported as having only limited success passing on cost increases. Retail prices were reported as either flat or up moderately from the previous survey.

2005-07-31,"Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that business activity continued to expand from mid-April through May. Most Districts--including New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minnesota, Kansas City, and San Francisco--characterized the pace of expansion as moderate, solid, or well-sustained. However, Philadelphia noted that the pace of growth had eased in May while Boston and Cleveland observed some unevenness across sectors.
Retail activity was mixed. Several Districts reported disappointing May retail sales results and cited unseasonable weather as the principal reason. A few reports mentioned that high gasoline prices were having a negative impact on sales. Almost all reports on other service industries were quite positive. Residential real estate markets remained strong in most Districts, and several Districts reported improving commercial real estate conditions. Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity continued to expand overall, although some reports described varying conditions across industries.
Labor markets improved in most Districts. Overall price pressures were moderate, but several reports noted concern over high fuel, transportation, and building materials costs.
Consumer Spending
Reports on retail sales in April and May were mixed. Richmond reported that May sales and store traffic picked up markedly, and Kansas City noted that consumer spending expanded solidly in April and May. St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco also reported gains in consumer spending. Sales were characterized as mixed by merchants in Atlanta and Cleveland and as having edged down in the Philadelphia District. Chicago retailers described sales as subdued, and those in New York reported sales as soft. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis noted that unseasonable weather had dampened sales in May. In addition, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas said that high gasoline prices had a negative impact on retail sales.
Automobile sales were reported as mixed by Atlanta, Kansas City, Chicago, and Dallas, sluggish in Cleveland, and down in the Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts. Meanwhile vehicle inventories were above desired levels according to Chicago, Philadelphia, and Dallas. Dealers in the Philadelphia area boosted leasing promotions to lower some excess inventories. Atlanta and San Francisco noted that high gasoline prices were having a negative impact on sales of SUVs and light trucks.
Services and Tourism
According to most reports, industries in the service sector continued to display solid growth in April and May. Dallas reported that the transportation industry continued to experience strong demand conditions, but also noted concerns about high fuel costs. San Francisco reported that demand for media and high-tech services strengthened and that activity among transportation, food, and healthcare service providers remained vigorous.
Reports from the tourism and hospitality industry remained positive. Tourism remained exceptionally strong in New York City. Manhattan's hotel occupancy rate was more than 2 percentage points higher in April than a year ago and average room rates were up 17 percent. Richmond said that hotel bookings at coastal hotels for the Memorial Day weekend were somewhat stronger than a year earlier and that rapidly rising demand for hotel rooms in the nation's capital drove room rates sharply higher in recent months. Atlanta also noted that hotel and resort occupancies were at high levels. St. Louis reported strong sales and employment gains in the hospitality services industry, and San Francisco reported that the travel and tourism sector continued to surge. Spring tourism was flat because of cool weather according to Minneapolis, but tourism officials remained optimistic about the summer season.
Construction and Real Estate
Reports on residential real estate markets remained quite positive overall, although some slowing in activity was noted in a few markets. Philadelphia and Atlanta reported that home sales were brisk and strong, respectively. St. Louis reported that home sales continued to rise, while Kansas City and Chicago stated that activity remained solid. San Francisco reported that home sales continued to be rapid, although growth slowed somewhat relative to previous periods. Richmond and New York said that housing markets remained strong, but both noted some easing in demand in high-end markets. Minneapolis described real estate markets as mixed. New home sales weakened slightly, according to Cleveland, and Dallas noted that in some parts of the District the supply of new homes had outstripped demand. St. Louis and Minneapolis cited permit data that indicated some moderation in construction is likely.
Several Districts reported improvements in commercial real estate markets. New York and Dallas saw signs of strengthening activity, with office vacancy rates retreating in several local markets. Leasing activity has been fairly strong, according to Philadelphia, and Richmond noted that rents firmed and new construction has increased. Atlanta saw solid improvements as firms moved forward with expansion plans; development also increased at a steady pace in Cleveland and Chicago and continued to improve in San Francisco. Modest improvements were noted by Kansas City and Minneapolis. However, St. Louis reported that commercial markets were mixed, and Boston noted that local markets continued to struggle.
Manufacturing
Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity continued to expand, although several Districts noted that production had slowed or leveled off. Atlanta and San Francisco reported that defense contracts had generated new orders for local manufacturers, while Boston and San Francisco cited strong demand for aircraft-related and computing equipment. Durable goods production was improving, according to Minneapolis and Cleveland, although Cleveland noted that steel production was softer. Boston and Dallas described manufacturing activity as mixed overall, and the pace of expansion, although positive, had reportedly slowed in some industries, according to San Francisco, Chicago, and Philadelphia. St. Louis, Boston, Minneapolis, and Chicago cited varying degrees of weakness in vehicle production, although Cleveland reported year-over-year gains in auto production in the two-month period ending in May. Several reports noted that manufacturing firms are planning to increase capital spending, open or expand plants, and increase operations to meet expected demand. The majority of Districts reported manufacturer concerns regarding higher input prices, especially in energy-related goods.
Banking and Finance
For most Districts reporting on financial services, the demand for loans either increased or remained solid. Most Districts cited increases in commercial lending activity, although Richmond noted a slower pace in some areas. Philadelphia linked new commercial borrowing to rising capital expenditures by firms in a wide range of industries. Atlanta and Chicago reported stronger consumer loan demand, but St. Louis and New York reported some slowdown, and Cleveland described activity as mixed. Residential real estate lending was described as rising or remaining solid in most Districts. Dallas reported some concern about a potential glut in multi-family residential properties. Other banking indicators were holding steady or improving, and credit quality was described as good.
Labor Markets and Prices
Labor market conditions continued to improve in most Districts, and several reports cited difficulty finding specific types of workers. For instance, Dallas reported a shortage of skilled workers in the energy industry, while Atlanta and San Francisco noted similar shortages in construction. Cleveland reported that manufacturing firms had difficulty obtaining qualified applicants for job openings. San Francisco described tighter supply conditions in nursing and financial service professions. The demand for temporary workers strengthened in the Richmond, New York, and Atlanta Districts, while Chicago noted a small decline from a year earlier. San Francisco and Dallas reported rising wages, mainly in professional services, while Minneapolis noted only modest increases in wages.
Reports from most Districts indicated that price increases at the retail level remained modest overall. San Francisco noted that price inflation for final goods and services edged up, largely because of the pass-through of earlier increases in energy costs. Several Districts noted increases in transportation and healthcare costs. Prices were up for construction-related materials, such as lumber, cement, brick, tile, and glass in many Districts. Some Districts noted that manufacturers were unable to pass along rising costs of raw materials because of the presence of long-term contracts and competitive pressures from foreign producers. However, Cleveland reported that firms have had some success in passing input cost increases along to their customers.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Despite less-than-ideal weather, crop conditions were described as between fair and good for most reporting Districts. Cold weather slowed plantings and crop development, according to Richmond and Kansas City. Also, heavy rains in California's central Valley region damaged some fruit crops. Dallas and San Francisco noted concerns over higher costs of fuel and fertilizers.
Activity in the energy industry has remained strong especially for oil field services. Dallas reported strong drilling activity, long backlogs, and a dearth of skilled workers. San Francisco and Minneapolis reported that producers were operating at or near full capacity. Kansas City noted that drilling firms expected moderate expansion of drilling activity in the months ahead.",1,1
2005-05-31,"Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that business activity continued to expand from late February through early April. Kansas City and San Francisco noted solid growth, Chicago and Dallas characterized growth as moderate, and Atlanta reported a robust pace. By contrast, while citing positive growth, New York and Cleveland mentioned uneven progress across sectors, and Richmond stated that signs of improvement in April followed a restrained March.
More than one-half of the Districts reported that retail activity was up, from modestly to strongly. Among the remaining Districts, Chicago said consumer spending was subdued, Dallas noted that retailers were disappointed with recent growth, and Cleveland reported some deterioration after improvement earlier in the year. Tourism was generally doing well in those Districts that mentioned it.
Districts described manufacturing activity as ahead of year-earlier or previously-reported levels, with reports ranging from ""rising briskly"" in the Kansas City District to ""continuing at solid levels"" for contacts around Chicago. Information on service industries was generally positive. Residential real estate markets remained strong across most of the country, while commercial real estate conditions varied. Price pressures have intensified in a number of Districts, and most report that high or rising energy prices are a concern across sectors.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
The majority of Districts experienced improving retail sales overall, but several showed flat or disappointing results. In Minneapolis, contacts indicated that retail sales increased between 5 percent and 12 percent over the previous year. St. Louis also reported strong growth, with Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco recording modest to solid gains. Among the remaining five Districts, New York, Chicago, and Dallas characterized consumer spending growth as either subdued or disappointing, while Cleveland and Richmond cited mixed trends during the reporting period. Contacts in these five Districts attributed sluggish spending in part to unfavorable weather conditions, and in part to high or rising energy and gasoline prices. Retail selling prices were described as reasonably stable to date, although some contacts cited evidence of increased prices and pricing power.
New vehicle sales were flat or slightly up in most of the Districts reporting on this category. The exceptions were San Francisco, which reported strong sales, and Dallas, where car sales were weaker than a year ago. Contacts in several Districts also mentioned softening demand for domestic vehicles, especially trucks and SUVs, although most dealers in the Richmond District said they had not seen a shift to smaller cars despite higher gasoline prices. In other product categories, apparel and jewelry sales were strong in many regions.
Spending on travel and tourism improved throughout much of the country. New York and San Francisco reported brisk activity compared with a year ago, citing rising occupancy rates and higher revenues per room. Bolstered by foreign visitors, Florida recorded high passenger counts on cruise lines and robust bookings at theme parks. Boston, Philadelphia, and Kansas City also reported stronger tourist-related growth. Weather was an important factor in the Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts, as areas with favorable winter weather enjoyed increased business while those with bad weather saw flat or sluggish growth.
Service Industries
In general, firms in the service sector enjoyed a moderate increase in activity. St. Louis reported expansion in most areas, and San Francisco noted solid demand growth, especially in health-care, transportation, and food services. According to Atlanta, temporary employee hiring maintained a brisk pace, while Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond observed some pickup in demand at employment agencies. By contrast, Chicago and Dallas indicated more modest growth at temporary staffing firms. Demand for trucking and shipping services in several Districts reportedly eased somewhat as firms began passing on higher fuel costs to customers. However, Philadelphia reported increased trucking activity despite higher freight rates. Dallas cited strong conditions in the accounting industry, while business at law firms remained unchanged. Boston identified robust demand at both advertising and management consulting firms.
Manufacturing 
The updates on manufacturing were largely positive. Eleven of the twelve Districts indicated that production or orders were rising, while Chicago characterized activity as continuing at solid levels with the exception of continued weakness in light vehicle production. Several Districts with largely upbeat reports nevertheless indicated that increases in manufacturing output may be moderating a little. For example, New York cited a ""loss of momentum"" in the manufacturing sector, and Cleveland stated that ""many firms noted flattening new orders growth"" for durable goods.
Districts reported strong or rising demand for various durable goods, including building materials, machinery and machine tools, fabricated metals, energy-related equipment, and defense equipment. Shortages of tires and metal parts were said to be constraining heavy truck and other production in Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Kansas City.
Manufacturers in all Districts were reportedly facing rising costs for a variety of inputs, most notably energy, transportation, petrochemicals, and other petroleum-based products. Moreover, according to Dallas, expansions of petrochemical capacity are not expected to provide price relief for at least another year. On the other hand, several Districts mentioned that steel prices were stabilizing, albeit at high levels, and Philadelphia's survey revealed that the number of companies saying prices had risen in March was lower than it had been during the fall and early winter.
Overall, manufacturers' output prices appear to be rising modestly. Most Districts found that firms were having partial success passing on higher energy and materials costs to their customers. However, several cited instances of firms having to rescind price increases and accept lower margins. Reduced margins remained the norm in the Cleveland District, and rising energy costs were specified as a source of ""concern"" or ""caution"" among manufacturers in New York, St. Louis, and Dallas.
Labor demand in the manufacturing sector appears to be mixed, with some Districts placing more emphasis on additions to employment and others on cutbacks. District reports on capital spending tended to be moderately positive. Kansas City referred to ""solid growth"" in capital investment, and Philadelphia took note of the fact that very few companies expect to reduce their capital spending in the coming six months. Nevertheless, Boston described manufacturers as ""closely managing"" their capital expenditures.
Real Estate and Construction
Residential real estate markets were very active during March and early April, with Districts noting increased activity levels compared with the previous report. Demand for houses was strong and residential sales were high in three-quarters of the Districts. New York, Richmond, and Atlanta cited low housing inventories, while Boston mentioned increased time on the market for high-priced homes. Several Districts indicated that home prices rose. Reports on new housing construction were more mixed. Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco said the pace of home construction was strong or picking up, but St. Louis and Dallas noted slower residential construction.
Commercial real estate markets varied. Office vacancy rates declined in New York, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. New commercial construction was robust in Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco, but slow in Richmond. Chicago reported steady vacancy and rental rates.
Banking and Finance 
For most Districts reporting on financial services, demand for loans increased across a range of categories. Almost all Districts mentioned increases in commercial lending activity, and Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted industrial lending as an area of strength. The Cleveland District cited increased demand for loans to the manufacturing industry, specifically. Reports on demand for mortgages were mixed, and the New York, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts noted weakness in refinancing activity. Demand for non-bank financial services was disappointing, with New York reporting a recent slowing in the securities industry, and investment companies from the Philadelphia District noting general caution on the part of investors.
Other banking indicators were holding steady or improving in some cases. Philadelphia and Kansas City reported growth in deposits, while Cleveland cited rising core deposits at larger banks. Credit conditions and delinquency rates have improved according to the New York, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts, and held roughly the same in the Dallas and Chicago Districts.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Planting activities are under way in the agricultural Districts, which generally reported good spring conditions. By exception, wet weather has caused delays in parts of the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, while drought conditions continued or worsened in parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. Still, contacts indicated that the winter wheat and other crops are generally in good shape, as are range land, pasturage, and livestock. However, canker disease required destruction of part of the Florida citrus crop. In addition, growers in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts are cutting planned soybean acreage, reflecting some concern about soybean rust. Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco contacts noted that fuel, fertilizer, and other input costs are rising. Chicago bankers voiced concern that higher rents and interest rates could adversely affect cash flow at large farming operations. Atlanta contacts reported strong export demand for cotton and poultry, while Dallas noted improved selling prices for wheat, corn, and soybeans and favorable prices for livestock.
Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas reported that activity in the energy sector is revving up. According to contacts in Dallas, the U.S. rig count is at the highest level since 1986, and drilling plans are increasing faster than predicted earlier this year. Kansas City respondents noted that shortages of labor and equipment are keeping drilling activity slightly below desired levels at some firms, while some Dallas contacts say they are thinking of adding capacity. In San Francisco, drilling costs are rising. Dallas contacts report that producers are turning their attention to coal-bed methane, tight gas, tar sands, and gas shale, while service companies seek to create new products to support the development of unconventional resources. In the Minneapolis District, a large-scale wind energy project is planned for Montana. Mining activity is also on the rise, with output stable or growing at Montana's iron, palladium/platinum, and copper mines.
Prices and Wages
Reports from many Districts suggested that upward price pressures have strengthened, although actual increases to date in vendor prices and selling prices have generally remained moderate. Much of the pressure derives from energy costs, although contacts cited the lower dollar and rising costs of building materials as well. Most Districts said manufacturers, retailers, or services firms were able to pass at least a portion of cost increases along to their customers. However, only Chicago and Dallas suggested that some contacts have raised prices enough to increase margins or profits.
In two-thirds of the Districts, retail or tourism contacts expressed concern that high energy prices were already, or could soon be, damping consumer demand. Distribution (shipping, trucking, freight, delivery) firms and utilities shared similar apprehensions, having imposed fuel surcharges in many cases, according to Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis. As noted above, manufacturers also mentioned rising energy costs. San Francisco stated that increasing costs have prompted manufacturers to ""keep production as close as possible to demand,"" and Dallas indicated that uncertainty about energy prices has added caution to the outlook for business activity.
Boston, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported modest or moderate wage increases in various sectors, as labor markets in a few areas or occupations became somewhat tighter. By contrast, Cleveland cited stable wages in trucking, and Dallas said its contacts saw little or no wage pressure. Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that benefits costs, especially health care, continue to rise.",0,1
2005-04-30,"Information received from District Banks suggests that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace since the last report. All twelve Districts indicated that economic activity has increased, though Richmond reported some deceleration in the pace of growth, while Dallas noted some acceleration. Relatively brisk growth was reported in the New York and San Francisco Districts.
Consumer spending was steady to up moderately, with a number of Districts noting sluggish auto sales. Retailers were mostly satisfied with current inventory levels and were generally optimistic about the outlook. Travel and tourism activity were characterized as strong, with a few exceptions. Reports from most other service industries also showed improvement. Nearly all Districts reported continued expansion in manufacturing activity. Housing markets and residential construction activity were described as robust in most areas, but commercial real estate markets were mixed. Most Districts reported little change in overall loan demand, though a few indicated some pickup.
Labor markets strengthened in almost all Districts; while wages continued to increase at a moderate pace, employers in many Districts reported ongoing pressures from higher benefit costs. Many Districts reported increased difficulty in locating skilled workers for at least some industries. A number of Districts reported increases in prices for manufactures and materials, but others noted some easing of input costs; prices of consumer goods and services were mixed but relatively flat, on balance.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Consumer spending has been steady to somewhat stronger since the last report. Overall retail sales strengthened in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, sales were reported to have been little changed in the other Districts. A number of reports from retailers indicated that apparel sold well, but others noted weak sales of electronics and big-ticket items. Automobile sales have been steady to softer in early 2005. Vehicle sales weakened in Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, while sales were said to be mixed in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. The Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts reported that auto sales picked up in February, after a sluggish January. Overall, retail inventories were said to be at satisfactory levels, though automobile inventories were said to be on the high side in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas.
Tourism showed increased strength in most Districts, though a few reported that activity was hampered by unfavorable weather. Robust tourism activity was noted in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco; New York attributed some of the strength to the Central Park ""Gates"" exhibit, Richmond cited unseasonably warm weather, and Atlanta noted some positive effect from the weaker dollar. On the other hand, Boston and Minneapolis indicated some softness in tourism, partly attributed to an unusual geographic distribution of winter snow.
Services
Activity in service-sector industries showed signs of strengthening since the last report. Boston, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported some pickup in demand for information technology services. New York reported strong conditions in the securities industry, and Dallas noted brisk demand for accounting services. Widespread strength was evident in the trucking and shipping industries: conditions were described as robust in Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco, and steady in Richmond. Conditions in the airline industry were mixed: Dallas reported weak conditions, while Chicago noted strong demand from business travelers, but some softness in the domestic leisure segment. More broadly, St. Louis and San Francisco cited general increases in service-sector activity, while Richmond reported that conditions were stable.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity was reported as expanding solidly in most Districts, although the pace of growth has generally not increased since the last report. Many Districts noted particularly strong gains in durable goods manufacturing. Defense-related production was reported as strong in the Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts; machine tool production was described as solid by several Districts; vehicle production remained at a high level, in part because of the strength in demand for heavy trucks; and construction materials were in high demand. Steel shipments softened in Cleveland, but were reported as solid in Chicago; Cleveland cited surging steel imports, whereas Chicago saw imports decline. High-tech manufacturing activity was reported as growing in the Dallas and Boston Districts but mixed in San Francisco, where the semiconductor industry showed strength but the telecommunications industry remained weak.
Sustained increases in the cost of energy, steel, and other materials were widespread. However, some moderation in the pace of cost increases was reported by the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts, with a faster rate of increase noted only by the Richmond District. A recent drop in energy prices was cited by some Districts as helping to stabilize input price increases. The weaker dollar reportedly has stimulated exports in the Atlanta District, although some Districts cited the dollar's decline as exerting continuing upward price pressures on imported inputs. Several Districts noted that their manufacturing contacts were optimistic that the coming year would bring continued growth, with some seeing expansion of factory headcounts.
Real Estate and Construction
Home sales markets remained strong across most of the nation. New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco continued to describe housing markets as robust. However, mixed conditions were reported in Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. The market for apartments was characterized as soft in Dallas, mixed in Chicago, but strong in New York. Home construction has been particularly brisk in the San Francisco and Atlanta Districts, whereas Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated some pullback.
Commercial real estate markets were, on balance, stable. Office markets were steady in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas, with Boston and Dallas noting substantial ongoing slack in the market. On the other hand, some firming was reported in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported some pickup in the market for industrial space, but Boston, New York, and Richmond reported steady to somewhat softer markets. Richmond noted a slight decline in retail vacancy rates.
There were scattered reports of increases in commercial construction activity. Philadelphia reported an increase in industrial building, Cleveland reported a pickup in retail construction, and Richmond noted two major office projects in the pipeline. Some general, albeit modest, increases in commercial construction were also reported in Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
Banking and Finance
Banks reported steady to somewhat stronger lending activity in early 2005. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts noted increases in overall loan demand. Rising demand for commercial mortgages was reported in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City, while San Francisco described demand as slowing but strong; Dallas, however, noted an increase in commercial property foreclosures. Business lending also strengthened in a number of Districts, but the reports on household loan demand were mixed, suggesting little change, on balance, for both consumer loans and residential mortgages. Home equity lending strengthened noticeably in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts but slipped in Kansas City.
Credit standards were unchanged across the board, and loan quality was widely described as steady and strong. Contacts in Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that the lending environment was highly competitive, leading to narrowing margins, while contacts in Dallas expressed some concern about excessive supply of funds available to commercial mortgage markets.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Above-average rainfall and moisture levels were reported in several Districts, which created a mix of favorable and unfavorable conditions. In the Dallas, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts, heavy precipitation helped planting conditions for the winter wheat crop but proved problematic for other crops. Improved conditions for livestock grazing were reported in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts. Atlanta's citrus industry continued to suffer from the after-effects of last year's hurricanes, as well as disease.
Activity in the energy industry was reported as buoyant and optimistic, given the continuing pattern of higher energy prices. The Dallas and Kansas City Districts reported an increase in active rigs since the last report. Capacity in the industry is being strained by labor and equipment availability, although activity is expected to continue to improve.
Labor Markets
Labor markets across the nation have been steady to stronger since the last report. Ongoing improvements in labor market conditions were reported in Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Minneapolis, and hiring activity has picked up recently in Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City. Brisk gains in temporary employment were seen in Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago, while, in Dallas, these job gains fell short of expectations.
Manufacturers were reported to be raising employment in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts. On the other hand, manufacturing employment has been steady to lower, on net, in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City. A number of industries have seen tightening labor markets across several Districts. Increased labor demand was reported in financial services (Boston, New York, Kansas City, and Dallas), legal services (New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas), and freight transportation and distribution (Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City). There were also reports of scattered skilled labor shortages in many Districts. New York and Cleveland noted a dwindling supply of skilled workers to fill job openings generally; and a number of other Districts reported shortages of skilled job applicants in specific industries, such as trucking, shipping, construction, energy, health care, and media.
Overall wage increases were characterized as moderate in all Districts. Still, a number of Districts cited larger wage gains in certain industries, including securities (New York), trucking (Cleveland and Kansas City), legal services (Minneapolis and Dallas), pharmaceutical services (Kansas City), and accounting (Kansas City and Dallas). Reports of ongoing sharp increases in benefit costs, particularly health insurance, were fairly widespread.
Prices
Retail prices were generally flat or up modestly; however, businesses continued to face rising input costs, and a number of Districts indicated greater ease in passing along price increases. Prices for finished goods were reported to be increasing modestly in Richmond and Minneapolis, but almost all of the other Districts characterized retail prices as flat. Cleveland and Chicago reported that motor vehicle prices were being reduced by increased incentives and discounts. A number of Districts also noted ongoing declines in apparel prices.
Despite the stability in consumer goods prices, manufacturers in a number of Districts--including Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas--indicated that they have been finding it increasingly easy to pass along price increases; Philadelphia producers anticipated greater ability to boost prices in the near future. Also, truckers in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts indicated that they have been offsetting rising fuel costs with surcharges.
A number of Districts reported persistent pressures on input costs, though some noted that these have eased since the last report. Firms in Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported sizable increases in prices of various raw materials. The most commonly mentioned were construction materials (especially steel) and fuel. Quite a few Districts also mentioned continued rapid escalation in health insurance costs, though San Francisco indicated that these have decelerated. More generally, New York, Cleveland and Chicago indicated that input cost pressures have abated somewhat since the last report.",0,0
2005-02-28,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicated that economic activity continued to expand from late November through early January. Eleven districts characterized activity as expanding with Atlanta, New York, and Richmond noting that the pace of activity had quickened since their last reports. The Cleveland District was less upbeat, characterizing economic activity in that district as mixed.
Consumer spending was generally higher since the last Beige Book and a number of districts reported that retail sales during the holidays were above year-ago levels. While the pace of spending was sluggish in a number of districts at the beginning of the period, it picked up appreciably by late December. Adding to the strength in household spending was an increase in tourism in several districts. Most districts reported that manufacturing activity firmed and many districts said that businesses planned to increase capital spending in 2005. Although several reports noted some slowing in residential real estate and construction activity, real estate markets remained generally strong. In the financial sector, lending activity was mixed, as modestly higher commercial and industrial lending was tempered by slower residential mortgage lending. Several districts noted that agricultural conditions were favorable and that activity in the energy sector remained strong. Labor markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest. Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Consumer spending increased in most districts since the last Beige Book report, with only Cleveland, Dallas, and New York reporting that sales were mixed. Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco said that retail sales were slow in early December but picked up the pace from Christmas through the end of the year. Sales of luxury goods were strong in the Kansas City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco districts, while retailers in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City districts reported that electronics and jewelry sold well during the holiday season. Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco reported higher sales of building supplies, and Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis noted stronger sales of apparel. Gift cards sold briskly according to the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and New York reports. Post-holiday retail inventories were at satisfactory levels in the Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco districts.
Automobile sales were mixed. Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City noted higher sales, but St. Louis and Dallas said new car sales slowed. Atlanta, Philadelphia, and San Francisco noted that sales of foreign cars outperformed domestic makes. Dealers in the Chicago, Dallas, and Philadelphia districts reported that automobile dealers' inventories remained above desired levels.
Tourist activity strengthened in several districts. Boston said that increased business travel, corporate spending, citywide conventions and increased international travel boosted hotel occupancy rates. Occupancy rates were also up in the San Francisco district, and the number of Japanese visitors to Hawaii has returned to pre-September 11 levels. New York noted that tourist activity was higher both upstate and in New York City where Broadway theaters set a box-office record during the last week of the year. In addition, the Atlanta report indicated that tourism was strong and that central Florida theme parks were filled to capacity. Kansas City indicated that some ski resorts in the district reported near-record levels of visitors. Richmond reported that because of unseasonably mild weather, hotels were booked to capacity in coastal areas and that some were turning tourists away during the week after Christmas.
Services
The Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis districts reported steady to stronger demand at services firms since the last Beige Book. Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, and St. Louis noted stronger demand for transportation services, with some seaports in the Atlanta district posting double-digit gains in both inbound and outbound shipping. Air passenger traffic was higher at airports in the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and New York districts while air freight volume increased in the Atlanta district. New York's report also noted that the securities industry ended 2004 on a strong note.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity strengthened since the last Beige Book report. Nine of the 12 districts indicated that factory output rose, while Chicago, Cleveland, and Richmond noted that production was steady. Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco indicated that demand for transportation equipment strengthened measurably. Production of electrical machinery increased in the Philadelphia district, and Chicago reported strong output of heavy equipment. Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that production of building materials picked up, while Chicago and San Francisco indicated that orders for machine tools increased in their districts. San Francisco also reported that semiconductor orders and sales were generally solid.
But some manufacturing sectors weakened. Richmond reported that textiles and apparel shipments continued to decline. Atlanta reported layoffs at a computer circuit board plant, and Dallas noted slowing demand in consumer communications equipment. Philadelphia indicated that demand softened for lumber and wood products, paper products, and plastics, and Cleveland reported that sales at automobile industry suppliers slowed at year-end. St. Louis said that firms in the fabricated metal product, wood product, chemical, and apparel industries announced plant closings and layoffs.
Looking ahead, manufacturers expected conditions to remain positive in coming months. Most districts reported that manufacturers intend to increase their capital spending in 2005. Firms in the Chicago district upped their planned capital expenditures for next year; most have already begun to place orders to accomplish those spending goals. Minneapolis indicated that expectations of higher sales by businesses led to plans to increase capital spending in 2005. Kansas City noted greater capital spending in 2005 to replace outdated equipment. Richmond reported that manufacturers planned to increase capital spending despite their skepticism about the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery.
Construction and Real Estate
Residential real estate activity generally remained strong. Atlanta, Boston, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco said that housing markets in their districts continued to show strength in the fourth quarter of 2004, and Dallas and St. Louis reported some improvement since the last Beige Book. Chicago reported mixed housing activity, possibly because of a seasonal slowdown in December, but noted a slight pickup in sales during the first week of January; real estate activity was also mixed in the Minneapolis district. The Kansas City District reported flat to slightly higher home sales compared with a year earlier. New York reported that prices for upper-end New Jersey properties leveled off, or pulled back, but that prices for Manhattan co-ops and condos continued to rise. Richmond said home prices continued to rise in most areas of that district.
Commercial real estate conditions strengthened in most districts in December and early January. Real estate agents in the Dallas, New York, Richmond, San Francisco, and St. Louis districts reported that leasing activity increased--particularly for office space. Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington, D.C., and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets. Contacts in New York said the recent uptick in activity sent the Class A office vacancy rate to a two-and-a-half-year low and may be a signal of increased hiring in that area. In other districts, vacancies were mixed--rates dipped in San Francisco, St. Louis, and most of the Kansas City District, but were generally unchanged in other areas. Adding to the positive tone, commercial construction activity was higher since the last Beige Book report--contacts in Atlanta, Chicago, Minnesota, Richmond, and St. Louis reported new industrial or office construction activity, while retail construction maintained a generally steady pace.
Banking and Finance
Lending activity remained generally mixed as slower residential mortgage lending offset somewhat higher commercial and industrial lending in many districts. Commercial lending was modestly higher in the Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco districts while commercial and industrial lending was stronger in the Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis districts. Residential mortgage lending, however, declined in the Chicago, Dallas, and New York districts.
Several districts reported that credit conditions were steady, though Dallas added that competition between banks in that district could threaten credit quality in the months ahead. In addition, Chicago and San Francisco reported that banks' profit margins on loans were thin.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Several districts noted that crop and livestock conditions were generally favorable, despite widely varying weather conditions. Richmond indicated that unseasonably warm weather in early December accelerated the development of winter grains and extended the grazing period for livestock. But very cold temperatures and snowfall in late December led to supplemental feeding of livestock. A major snow storm affected part of the St. Louis District in late December, leaving fields and pastures muddy. Despite the excess soil moisture, St. Louis said the winter wheat crop was in mostly fair to good condition. Minneapolis noted that Montana's 2005 winter wheat crop was good to excellent despite little snow cover to protect against freeze or wind damage. Kansas City added that some producers in the western part of its district remained concerned that dry pastures could deteriorate further.
Agricultural prices were generally higher. The Chicago district reported that net farm income jumped last year as a result of profitable livestock operations and record corn and soybean harvests, much of which was forward-contracted at unusually high prices. In addition, Minneapolis reported milk prices were higher.
Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. Minneapolis indicated increased mining activity, noting that the delivery of some mining machinery required two-year waits. Kansas City reported that oil and gas drilling rig counts remained well above year-ago levels, and noted constraints on drilling due to labor and equipment shortages. Dallas added that the level of land drilling was mostly unchanged but that offshore activity had picked up.
Labor Markets
Districts generally reported firmer labor markets in late 2004. Contacts in Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond reported improvement on the job front, while respondents in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco saw little change in hiring activity.
Manufacturing employment rose in Kansas City, New York, Richmond and St. Louis, while factory owners in Philadelphia anticipated adding workers in coming months. Planned factory hiring in Cleveland was mixed by product type--producers of nondurable goods predicted little change in future hiring, but makers of durable goods anticipated adding to their payrolls in the months ahead. Services sector respondents in Dallas, Richmond, and St. Louis reported broad-based strengthening in services sector employment, and contacts in New York and Philadelphia noted a particularly strong pickup in securities industry hiring.
Information on employment staffing services firms was mostly positive, but varied by district. Contacts in Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis reported a moderate to brisk rise in demand, but Richmond noted generally flat activity and Dallas reported a softening in demand for temporary workers. Chicago also experienced a modest decline, but attributed it to a normal seasonal lull.
The reports from Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated that wage increases generally continued to be modest. However, Cleveland noted that in response to the strong pickup in shipping demand, trucking firms have been attempting to expand their workforce by raising their wage rates and offering nonpecuniary incentives. Kansas City also noted higher wages for skilled factory workers in short supply, while Richmond noted that wage increases picked up in the services sector.
Prices
Inflationary pressures remained largely in check in December and early January. While many manufacturers and builders continued to report small increases in input costs, price increases for final goods and services were generally modest.
In manufacturing, input prices rose modestly in most districts, but Boston and Minneapolis reported that some input prices rose sharply. Manufacturers of nondurable goods in the Cleveland district noted that prices for raw materials continued to rise, while prices for durable goods inputs were steady. Prices charged by manufacturers increased modestly in Kansas City, New York, and Richmond, and remained in check in Atlanta and Chicago. Increases in the costs of building materials were mixed by district. Modest to sharp price hikes were widely reported in Atlanta, Kansas City, and Minneapolis, but material prices were flat in Cleveland and New York, and eased somewhat in San Francisco.
Overall, price inflation remained relatively steady in recent weeks. Reports from Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco reported that price increases remained largely in check. Contacts in Dallas noted that many firms were unable to pass rising costs along to the customer due to stiff competition, and Chicago noted that competition in the retail sector is expected to limit price increases.",1,1
2004-11-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally indicated that economic activity continued to expand in September and early October. Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted continued expansion in economic activity. Richmond and Dallas said the pace had quickened, while New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco suggested that growth had moderated somewhat. St. Louis received mixed reports on economic activity, and Atlanta cited widespread hurricane-related disruptions. Many reports suggested that higher energy costs were constraining consumer and business spending.
Reports on consumer spending in September and early October were mixed by District and spending category. In contrast, business outlays appeared to pick up in most regions, with modest increases in both capital spending and hiring. Residential real estate activity remained robust in most Districts, although it slowed in some. Nonresidential activity was still relatively weak across the nation, though there were scattered signs of improvement. Manufacturing activity increased further since the last Beige Book. Household loan demand seemed to soften somewhat, but business loan demand picked up. Businesses in most Districts continued to express concern over the rising costs of energy and other inputs, although more manufacturers and business service providers were reportedly able to pass part--if not all--of these cost increases along to their customers. However, increases in wages and retail prices generally were subdued. Fall harvests were ahead of the normal pace, and yields of corn and soybeans were expected to set records in some Districts. Energy-related activities continued to increase, despite some disruptions caused by Hurricane Ivan.
Consumer spending/tourism
Consumer spending in September and early October was mixed by region and category. Many Districts indicated that retail sales were soft during the reporting period, while others noted modest improvement. Apparel sales were mixed across the nation. Unseasonably warm temperatures were blamed for weak sales of fall merchandise in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts. Hurricanes disrupted retail activity in the Atlanta District, though they did provide a boost to sales of building materials. Most retailers appeared content with inventory levels heading into the holiday shopping season. Light vehicle sales were strong in many Districts during September, although they dropped off in early October. Boston, New York, and San Francisco reported strong tourism activity, but Atlanta said that tourism ""took a substantial hit because of the hurricanes."" Contacts in many Districts said that high energy costs were constraining household spending, and some said the presidential election was heightening uncertainty among consumers.
Business spending/hiring
On balance, capital spending appeared to pick up modestly. Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City reported that manufacturing firms increased their capital outlays, while Cleveland and St. Louis said that spending was mixed by industry segment. Chicago added that special factors, such as expiring tax incentives and changing environmental regulations, contributed to higher capital outlays. Several Districts reported strong demand for transportation services, and shipping companies were said to be purchasing equipment to keep up with rising freight volumes. With regard to other business spending, Philadelphia noted an increase in technology spending while Chicago and San Francisco reported gains in advertising.
Hiring activity varied by region and industry, but appeared to increase modestly. Nearly half of the Districts said that demand for temporary help increased since the last Beige Book, although momentum slowed in some areas. Reports of permanent hiring became more frequent, notably in manufacturing industries. Five District reports suggested a general increase in manufacturing jobs, while none indicated an outright decline. Boston noted some ""sizable increases"" in retail employment, and Richmond said that a broad array of service-producing firms were adding workers. Hiring reportedly improved in financial services (New York and Minneapolis) and transportation (Dallas) as well.
Some Districts continued to report isolated shortages of workers in particular occupations such as skilled manufacturing (Boston, Chicago), truck drivers (Cleveland), and upper-level finance occupations (Minneapolis). In addition, some Districts noted signs of more broad-based firming of labor markets. New York said ""there are fewer people seeking (office worker) positions;"" contacts in the Richmond District suggested there were ""fewer qualified candidates to fill permanent positions;"" Chicago noted there were ""fewer applications for open positions;"" and Minneapolis indicated that ""labor markets have tightened for a number of industries.""
Construction/real estate
Residential construction and real estate activity was robust again in September, although it appeared to soften further from the last Beige Book. New York was the only District to report a general increase in housing market activity. Boston and Kansas City said that sales of high-end homes had softened, and Cleveland reported weakness at all price points. Home prices continued to increase at a healthy pace in most areas. However, a Realtor in Minneapolis suggested some slight price reductions, and homebuilders in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts reportedly raised incentives and/or lowered prices to spur demand.
On balance, nonresidential activity remained weak in most Districts, but there were scattered signs of improvement. Chicago and Dallas noted some pickup in office markets, and Cleveland reported particular strength in the light industrial segment. The Richmond and Chicago Districts said that retail real estate activity remained robust.
Manufacturing
District reports suggested that manufacturing activity expanded further from the previous Beige Book. Reports ranged from solid expansion in the Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts to decidedly mixed in St. Louis. Hurricanes caused some production disruptions in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. Stronger activity was evident across a wide array of industry segments, though, on balance, producers of durable goods exhibited more strength than producers of nondurable goods. A number of Districts reported continued strength in metals production, Richmond and Dallas noted improvements in petroleum-based products (such as plastics and petrochemicals), and Chicago said that demand for heavy equipment was still very strong. Demand for high-tech goods was mixed. Boston and San Francisco noted some softening in their semiconductor industries, but Dallas said that strong orders for consumer electronics helped boost demand for semiconductors. The September surge in light vehicle sales helped bring bloated inventories down to more desirable levels. Still, Cleveland pointed out that domestic automakers had announced production cuts.
Banking/finance
Loan demand followed a pattern similar to that reported in the last Beige Book; the household sector softened a bit while loan demand from businesses strengthened somewhat. The moderation on the household side largely reflected a decline in mortgage applications. While new originations were holding up in most Districts, refinancing activity fell off. There were no changes reported in standards and terms for household loans, and credit quality continued to improve. Many Districts indicated that business borrowing had increased; New York was the only District to note a slowdown in business lending and tighter standards on business loans. In general, business loan quality remained high and even improved in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts.
Prices/employment costs
Wage pressures generally remained stable, according to most District reports. Contacts in the Chicago District, however, said that wages continued to trend higher and, for the first time in several years, some firms had begun paying hiring and retention bonuses again. In addition, there were scattered reports of wage increases in occupations where workers were in particularly short supply, such as truck drivers and skilled tradespeople. Kansas City noted that firms in energy drilling activities had raised wages 10 percent or more to attract entry-level workers. Contacts in much of the nation continued to express concern about high benefits costs, most notably for health insurance.
Firms across the nation also expressed concern about higher input costs, particularly for energy and petroleum-based products, metals, and construction materials. Three broad industry categories were disproportionately affected by these increases: transportation, manufacturing, and construction. Six of the twelve District reports suggested that trucking firms were able to pass along most, if not all, of the cost increases to their customers. In contrast, Atlanta said that trucking firms were having a more difficult time increasing rates, and Chicago and Dallas indicated that competitive pressures were preventing airlines from passing along higher jet fuel costs. Manufacturers said that prices remained elevated for some other inputs, such as metals and plastics. While some Districts said that manufacturing firms had little success in passing along higher materials costs, one-third noted that more of their producers' customers were accepting price increases. Prices continued to rise for building materials in short supply, such as metals, concrete, and lumber. Here again, many builders had to absorb the higher input costs, but builders in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts were able to pass along at least some of these increases to homebuyers.
Despite mounting cost pressures, most District reports suggested that retail price increases were still largely subdued. Boston was the only District to indicate that retailers were able to raise prices to the consumer in response to higher costs.
Agriculture/natural resources
Fall harvests were ahead of the normal pace in much of the country, as growing conditions improved in September and early October. Corn and soybean yields were expected to set records in some Districts. With lower current prices for corn and soybeans, more producers planned to store crops in hope of higher prices in the future. There were reports of storage and transportation constraints for corn. A record cotton harvest was expected in Texas, but both cotton and citrus crops in the Southeast experienced significant damage as a result of the hurricanes. Demand for livestock remained strong. Moreover, Kansas City and Dallas reported that pasture conditions had improved, and ranchers in the Dallas District suggested these conditions were ""conducive for herd expansion.""
Activity in the energy industry continued to increase, despite some disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico resulting from Hurricane Ivan. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and, to a lesser extent, Dallas reported increased drilling for oil and natural gas.",1,1
2004-10-31,"Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand in late July and August, although several districts indicated that the pace had slowed since their last reports. Districts' characterizations of the rate of expansion ranged from slow (St. Louis) to solid (San Francisco), with many districts reporting modest or moderate growth.
Household spending was reported to have softened in many parts of the nation, reflecting lackluster retail sales and some cooling in new and existing home sales. Conditions in the manufacturing sector, on the other hand, improved further nationwide, especially among capital equipment and other durable goods makers. Residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some regions; nonresidential construction remained tepid, as did demand for commercial and industrial space. Agricultural conditions were mixed and generally tied to the weather. Demand for consumer loans softened somewhat, but several districts noted increased commercial lending. Employers in most districts continued to expand payrolls, though districts reported some unevenness across sectors. While persistently rapid increases in nonwage labor costs continued to be a concern for many employers, wage pressures remained modest. Consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly, although there were noticeable price increases for energy and some material inputs.
Consumer Spending
Consumer spending was mixed across districts and across products in late July and August, with the pace of spending slowing on balance relative to the previous survey period. Retail sales were described as solid in San Francisco, mixed in Dallas, and softer in New York, Richmond, and Chicago. Despite the recent slowing in retail sales, several Reserve Banks noted that sales were still up on a year-over-year basis. By category, a few districts singled out computers and other electronics and women's accessories and jewelry as being in particularly strong demand. Sales of back-to-school items, especially children's apparel, reportedly were disappointing for retailers in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. By contrast, Kansas City indicated that sales of these items were up solidly from previous years, and Philadelphia noted that they were in line with merchants' expectations.
With respect to autos, sluggish sales, high inventories, or both were noted by contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. St. Louis, San Francisco, and Kansas City, on the other hand, reported improvement in motor vehicle sales. In terms of composition, Kansas City and Dallas indicated that SUVs and light trucks did not sell as well as smaller vehicles, though the opposite was true in Atlanta and Chicago.
Business conditions in the travel and tourism sector were reported to be strong on balance in the districts of San Francisco, Kansas City, Atlanta, and New York, and in some areas of the Minneapolis and Boston Districts. Rainy weather in the Northeast and unusually cool weather in northern Minnesota damped travel to those areas. Hurricane Charley and Tropical Storm Gaston deterred travel and tourism to some coastal areas in the Richmond District. The Atlanta District noted that most central Florida tourist attractions closed for only one day because of the hurricane, and damage to the theme parks was limited.
Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
Total manufacturing activity increased throughout the country. Districts noted that manufacturers of durable goods, including many types of capital equipment, showed the largest increases. Specifically, strong demand was reported for aerospace products (Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco), steel products (St. Louis), industrial machinery (Richmond and Chicago), and IT products (Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco). In addition, Philadelphia noted increased demand for instruments and electrical equipment. The few indications of weakness in selected manufacturing sectors came from the St. Louis District, which reported that firms in home fixtures, furniture, and electronic cable manufacturing anticipate plant closings, and the Cleveland District, where nondurables manufacturers noted high inventories of finished-goods and flat to falling capacity utilization. Reduced demand for transportation equipment in the Philadelphia District and for apparel in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts also was reported.
The generally robust activity in manufacturing boosted demand for transportation services in many districts. Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported strong demand for overland shipping services, which resulted in bottlenecks in freight movement in some areas. According to the San Francisco District, high volumes of international trade kept several West Coast seaports operating at capacity, which also led to increased demand for rail services. Similarly, New York noted that volume through the Port of New York and New Jersey rose substantially in July and August.
Regarding other services, activity during the survey period was mixed. St. Louis and San Francisco noted improvement in demand for health-care services; San Francisco also reported improved demand for the services of advertising and media firms. In contrast, in the Richmond District, service firms reported generally weaker customer demand, and the New York District cited a contact who reported weakened demand in the securities industry. Boston noted deceleration in demand for software and IT services in late July and August, despite increased demand for IT hardware.
Real Estate and Construction
Home price appreciation, home sales, and residential construction activity remained at high levels in most districts, although there were numerous reports of slight cooling in market activity. Signs of moderation in the pace of home price appreciation and/or sales were reported by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco. The Dallas report described housing markets in Texas as ""lively,"" but noted little increase in median home prices this year.
Commercial real estate markets were little changed from the last survey period. Most districts reported stable but high vacancies and steady but low rents. That said, there were, scattered reports of improvement. The New York District reported that the office market in Manhattan strengthened further in July and the Richmond District noted commercial leasing activity increased in the Washington, D.C., area. Also, the St. Louis District indicated slow improvement in commercial and industrial real estate markets.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Agricultural output and conditions in late July and August varied across the nation, with weather, as usual, playing the key role. Cooler-than-normal weather in many parts of the country, most notably the agricultural regions of the St. Louis, Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts, slowed crop development. The Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond Districts noted that excessive rainfall hampered crop development. The Atlanta and Richmond Districts bore the brunt of Hurricane Charley, though its damage to crops reportedly was limited to coastal areas. Atlanta reported that the USDA estimated that Hurricane Charley ruined around 20 percent of this year's citrus harvest, including about 10 percent of the orange crop.
Higher energy prices continued to encourage oil and gas extraction. Kansas City reported that the count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region increased slightly from the previous survey period and was up strongly from a year ago. Oil drilling activity also was reported to have increased in the Dallas District.
Financial Services and Credit
Loan demand improved on net in many districts in recent weeks, as an uptick in demand for commercial loans offset some softening in consumer loan demand. Credit quality for both loan types was steady to slightly improved. Reports indicate that demand for commercial and industrial loans increased in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Commercial lending was flat in Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Respondents in two of the districts where commercial lending was flat--Chicago and Kansas City--indicated that loan demand from businesses was restrained to some extent by the use of internal financing, as the cash flow of many businesses improved.
On the consumer side, loan demand moderated somewhat in several districts, largely due to a falloff in mortgage lending. Some districts reported continued moderate increases in consumer loans, but several noted softening demand for home purchase and refinance loans. In characterizing home loan demand, the Chicago and Kansas City Districts indicated slight increases, and Richmond reported moderate increases. Cleveland, New York, Dallas, and San Francisco all noted softening in demand for home loans, while Philadelphia described demand for such loans as mixed.
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
Reports from most districts suggest continued gains in jobs during the recent survey period, although with some uneveness across sectors and regions. Several districts noted a pickup in demand for temporary service workers, including those in manufacturing, and one district (Atlanta) reported an increase in the rate of conversion of temporary workers to permanent hires. District reports also mentioned increased hiring in the energy, transportation services, durable goods manufacturing, and health-care sectors. The Cleveland and San Francisco Districts reported a pickup in labor demand among banks. Hiring reportedly was more subdued among producers of nondurable goods and selected services firms. In some cases, job losses were recorded: apparel manufacturers continued to shed jobs in the Atlanta District, and some financial and educational services providers scaled back employment in the St. Louis District.
Wage increases remained modest overall, although there were reports of upward wage pressures for selected occupations and industries. Reports indicated that wage pressures were building for skilled workers, and remaining flat for other types of workers. District reports continued to note concerns among businesses about the rising cost of health care and other employee benefits.
The reports indicated that consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly in late July and August, although they continued to cite noticeable price increases for oil, natural gas, steel, lumber, cement, concrete, and other building materials. This characterization of price developments was widespread across the districts. In addition, Cleveland and Dallas noted price increases for processed foods, and Chicago indicated that higher oil prices have driven up the cost of plastics, rubber, and other petroleum-based materials. Despite the high oil prices, however, two districts (Minneapolis and Dallas) reported that gasoline prices had increased only moderately if at all. In this regard, refiners in the Dallas District reported that the steep rise in crude oil prices relative to gasoline has squeezed margins.",0,1
2004-08-31,"Federal Reserve districts reported that economic activity continued to expand in June and early July, although several districts reported that the rate of growth moderated. The Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts characterized growth rates as ranging from modest (Minneapolis) to solid (Chicago), while New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted that growth rates slowed somewhat in their districts. Boston cited mixed reports from its business contacts. Reports of rising prices at the producer level continued to be common, though increases in retail prices were only infrequently reported. While wage gains remained generally flat, benefits costs continued to rise.
Retail sales were widely cited as having slowed; in particular, most districts reported that auto sales were flat to down. Manufacturing activity increased across the country, though there were pockets of weakness and gains were generally more measured than in the early spring. Travel and tourism were reported to be strong in many districts. Regarding construction, the pattern of past reports continued, as residential construction was still strong across most districts, while nonresidential building remained generally weak. In the banking sector, borrowing by commercial clients rose moderately in most districts. In the consumer lending category, mortgage originations were reported to be robust, but refinancings fell further. Agricultural conditions across the country were mixed, as some areas suffered from unusually wet weather. Mining and energy enterprises saw increases in activity in recent weeks.
Cost pressures were cited for a variety of production inputs in most districts. Energy, steel, and cement prices were widely cited as high and were reported to have moved higher in most districts. Some agricultural product prices, including beef, chicken, and milk, were also cited as adding to pricing pressures. The degree to which businesses have been able to pass along these prices continued to vary, but no district reported an acceleration in general retail prices. The few reports of labor shortages were narrow in scope. Wage increases were also widely reported to be moderate. However, businesses continued to cite health care costs as a factor in significantly boosting total labor costs.
Consumer Spending 
Consumer spending moderated across much of the country in June and early July, following strong increases in spending in the early spring. Seven districts reported that consumer spending had softened since their last reports: New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. In the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts, much of the moderation in spending was attributed to weather that was cooler than typical for the time of year.
Kansas City reported that spending had stayed largely flat in recent weeks, while Richmond reported that spending remained flat or was lower. Boston characterized consumer spending in its district as mixed. The districts reporting increases in spending were St. Louis and Minneapolis. St. Louis indicated that consumer spending was strong, whereas Minneapolis characterized spending as showing modest increases. A few districts noted that there were some indications of increases in spending in early July.
Auto sales were generally weak throughout the country in the late spring. Compared with sales in previous months, auto sales in June were characterized as flat or falling by the Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Among the districts that commented on automobile sales, only St. Louis indicated that auto sales rose in recent months.
Home furnishings and home improvement items sold well in the Boston, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, but New York noted that these products sold less well in its district than they had previously. Apparel sold poorly in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts, but the Dallas District reported that sales of women's apparel was strong. The environment for travel and tourism was reported to be improving in the New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, but mixed in the Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts.
Manufacturing and Other Business Activity 
Manufacturing firms across the county continued to report increases in production, continuing the pattern of strong production gains seen throughout the earlier part of 2004. All districts reported increases in production in June and early July, though the Richmond, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts reported that the pace of increases slowed somewhat. By contrast, Chicago and Kansas City reported robust activity in their districts, and steel production continued to be brisk throughout the Midwest. Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City also reported that firms' expansion of their capital stock continued at a moderate pace; Boston, by contrast, reported that firms in its district do not plan to add additional capital this year beyond already-budgeted increases.
Reports of scattered shortages and longer lead times are an indication of the strength of demand for manufactured items. For instance, significantly longer lead times for many industrial inputs were reported in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts. Contacts in the Chicago and St. Louis Districts saw shortages of cement; these shortages had been confined to the East and West Coasts in the past. The Cleveland and Chicago Districts noted that shortages of scrap steel continued to constrain production at some of their facilities.
Transportation-related issues were reported in several districts as well. St. Louis and Kansas City reported delays in coal shipments due to crowded railroad lines; contacts in the Dallas District also expressed concerns about congested railroad lines. And Boston noted that declines in trucking capacity had resulted in rising shipping prices. Transportation and shipping services were in high demand across the country, with Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reporting strong increases in activity in recent months for the shipping firms in their districts.
Both the Cleveland and Chicago Districts indicated that production at their auto assembly plants was below the levels of this time last year. St Louis reported that an auto manufacturer in its district will idle some of its plants in order to reduce inventories.
Construction and Real Estate 
Most districts reported that new home sales stayed strong through the end of June. The Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported rising new home sales in recent weeks. Reports from New York, Cleveland, and Richmond indicated that new home sales slowed in these districts but remained at high levels. Boston reported that higher-priced homes remained on the market longer in its district than they typically have. Cleveland and Minneapolis reported that sales in the lower-price parts of their markets slowed in May and June, though Kansas City reported that this was the strongest-selling market segment in its district.
Commercial construction continued to be weak throughout the country. St. Louis, an exception, said that commercial construction showed some improvement in most of its district. Commercial building in the Kansas City and Chicago Districts was characterized as flat, while activity in Minneapolis's district appeared mixed.
Banking and Finance 
Most districts reported increases in borrowing in recent months. Commercial lending improved through the end of June, with the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reporting rising commercial borrowing in recent weeks. New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta, however, noted that the increases in their districts were modest. In the Chicago District, commercial borrowing was characterized as flat.
In general, consumer borrowing also rose recently, but seemingly more moderately than commercial borrowing. Within the consumer borrowing category, five districts reported increases in their banks' residential real estate lending: Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis. Several of these districts indicated that although overall residential real estate lending had risen, the volume of refinancings fell further recently. Both the New York and San Francisco Districts saw borrowing by homebuyers decline, but San Francisco noted that the levels of residential real estate lending in its district remained high.
Natural Resources and Agriculture 
Assessments of the agricultural sector varied according to weather conditions, but demand kept prices high for a variety of products. Cool or wet weather hindered crop growth in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Outcomes were reported to be mixed by the Richmond District, as thunderstorms alleviated drought conditions but also caused wind damage. Favorable conditions were noted by Dallas and San Francisco. Cleveland noted that agricultural prices (beef, chicken, and milk) continued to rise for its food processors, while San Francisco noted high prices for beef cattle and other livestock, milk, berries, grapes, and nuts.
Activity in extractive industries remains at a high level. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported higher levels of activity at oil and gas drilling rigs. Minneapolis and Kansas City noted that equipment shortages (and labor as well in the case of Kansas City) were holding back exploration activities. Dallas cited a lack of domestic prospects as limiting drilling activity and noted that oil-field service companies reported excess capacity. Minneapolis also reported that mining activities in its district have been very strong.
Labor Markets, Wages and Prices 
Most districts reported strengthening labor market conditions. Employment agencies reported rising demand for labor in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts. Reports from other employers were more varied, but still positive, in most districts. The weakest employment reports were from Boston, Cleveland, and Dallas, where reports of employment gains were either mixed (some industries up, some industries down) or relatively rare. Limited occupational shortages were reported in Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco. San Francisco reported the broadest areas of shortage: ""skilled occupations in a number of industries, including construction, manufacturing, financial services, and technology services."" Overall, however, districts reported only modest wage increases. Boston and San Francisco reported that rising health care costs are a continuing concern for businesses.
A wide variety of material input costs were cited as high and steady or rising by several districts, yet retail price inflation was typically reported to be moderate. All districts reported some form of higher input costs, but the degree to which these costs could be passed on varied by industry and district. Typical reports from manufacturers suggested that they have been unable to charge higher prices to fully offset increases in their input prices. For example Chicago reported, ""While more manufacturers reportedly were adding surcharges to at least partially cover these higher costs, many others still said that competition prevented them from passing any cost increases on to their customers."" The Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts all reported material cost pressures in the construction sector. Atlanta reported that strong demand conditions had made it easier to pass on these higher costs, but Cleveland and Chicago reported that contacts had less success passing on cost increases in construction.",0,1
2004-07-31,"Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicate that economy activity in April and May continued to expand across the nation. Manufacturing activity continued to rise in most districts, with several districts describing the increases as broad-based. Most Federal Reserve districts reported increased demand for services. Retail sales remained even or rose in most districts. Residential real estate markets remained strong, and a few districts noted stable or improving conditions in commercial real estate markets. Bank lending activity increased in most districts. Conditions in the agricultural sector were reported as favorable, and the demand for agricultural products remained solid. Employment activity continued to improve, with hiring increasing at a faster pace in most districts; meanwhile, wages and salaries experienced little or muted upward pressures. Many Reserve Banks reported modest increases in consumer prices, but most districts noted rising prices of inputs, especially energy-related products, building materials, and steel.
Consumer Spending
The reports on overall retail sales in most Federal Reserve districts were generally positive. Sales were strong at discount and drug stores. Apparel and accessories, office supplies, food and other consumables, home products, and summer seasonal items were strong sellers in most districts. In contrast, sales of high-end electronics and appliances and specialty and gift items were soft in most districts. Districts reporting strong sales growth include New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis reported slight to moderate increases in sales. Retailers in the Dallas district offered mixed reports of both strong and soft sales growth, while Cleveland reported sales about even with 2003 levels. Boston reported year-over-year increases, but noted that sales growth had slowed since the first months of this year. General retailers throughout the districts expressed cautious optimism about sales in the coming months. Retailers in the Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco districts expressed concerns about the effects of increasing energy prices on sales.
Vehicle sales increased modestly in many districts and remained flat or slightly down in the others. San Francisco reported strong auto sales, attributing the continued strength to the availability of financing incentives. A number of districts noted that sales of light, fuel-efficient autos had increased; dealers in Philadelphia and San Francisco also noted that sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles had decreased because of rising gasoline prices. Minneapolis also reported strong sales, while dealers in Kansas City saw a modest increase; both districts noted that rising gasoline costs had not impeded sales of sport utility vehicles. In Dallas, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis auto sales were flat or slightly up from 2003 levels. Atlanta reported sales growth in April, although sales are still below 2003 levels. In Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco auto dealers reported inventories above desired levels.
Manufacturing and Other Business Activity 
Overall manufacturing activity increased in all Federal Reserve districts in April and May. Districts noted particularly strong growth in the defense, semiconductor, food processing, paper, lumber and other building products, textiles, automotive parts, furniture, heavy and other industrial equipment, metal products, transportation equipment, packaging, and recreational equipment and parts sectors. Districts reporting declines in activity in some sectors were Boston (home goods), Philadelphia (transportation equipment and food products), Richmond (furniture), St. Louis (paper materials and textiles), and San Francisco (commercial aircraft). Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago reported intensifying cost pressures because of rising input costs, especially for steel and related products, petrochemical products, and wood products. Chicago and Cleveland reported robust demand for steel. Chicago also reported that steel producers' orders were booked for the foreseeable future and that heavier shipping volumes were leading to a surge in truck demand.
Activity in the services sector increased in most areas throughout the districts. Demand for freight transportation services increased in the Cleveland, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis districts. Rising demand for trucking services, coupled with limited capacity, led some firms to announce new hires and capital expansions. In addition, transportation firms are more readily passing on cost increases from rising fuel and healthcare coverage costs to their customers. Tourism was up in most districts, including Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco, although some contacts expressed concerns that rising fuel costs will dampen summer travel. Other services sectors reporting growth were the software and information technology, financial, insurance, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors.
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate activity remained robust in most districts. Home sales were exceptionally strong in the Richmond district, and Kansas City had sales in April and May that were much higher than the previous year's levels. Some areas in the San Francisco district had an increase in sales at a near-record pace. Home price appreciation was steady in Philadelphia ; however, contacts remarked that homes were taking longer to sell than earlier in the year. The New York district reported that the housing market was still strong but indicated that sales were leveling off in New York City. Single-family housing permits were up in most of the St. Louis district, as well as in the Minneapolis and New York districts. One exception was the Chicago district, where permits were down. Dallas reported a large increase in home construction, leading to a rise in inventories. Kansas City reported that the high-end market was weaker than the entry-level market, and in Chicago sales of both new and existing high-end homes softened. According to contacts in the Chicago, Dallas, and Richmond districts, ""fence-sitters"" were jumping into the market in anticipation of a rise in mortgage rates.
Commercial real estate markets were mostly slack, although a few districts noted signs of moderate improvement. Areas with continuing high vacancy rates, slow leasing activity, and low or flat rents in April and May were downtown Boston and the St. Louis and Chicago districts. One major exception was the Washington, D.C., area of the Richmond district, where leasing activity increased substantially in recent weeks. Leasing activity improved somewhat in the Philadelphia district. Contacts in Dallas were optimistic that commercial markets were recovering, particularly since industrial demand had increased slightly over the past six weeks. Contacts had a positive outlook for the near future in Atlanta and Kansas City, where vacancies are expected to decrease over the remainder of the year. Nonresidential construction activity was mixed. Although construction in Atlanta remained at low levels, the Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Cleveland districts reported some improvement.
Banking and Finance 
In most Federal Reserve districts, lending activity increased. Only the St. Louis and Chicago districts reported that overall lending activity was flat. Atlanta, Cleveland, and San Francisco reported strong loan demand, while Philadelphia, New York, Kansas City, Dallas, and Richmond indicated a slight increase in loan demand. Mortgage loan demand remained strong in the San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, and Philadelphia districts, held steady in the St. Louis and Richmond districts, and fell in the New York district. The decline in refinancing activity reported in Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Richmond districts was often linked to the rise in mortgage interest rates. Only the Cleveland district reported strong refinancing. Deposits were flat in the Kansas City district, down in the Dallas district, and up in the Cleveland district. Lending standards were generally unchanged in the St. Louis, New York, and Kansas City districts; however, the Chicago district reported some lowering of standards because of competition.
Agriculture 
Agricultural conditions across the nation were generally favorable. Recent rains have brought relief from drought conditions in the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts and have improved soil moisture levels in St. Louis, parts of Richmond, and Dallas, where contacts reported the most favorable levels in five years. However, heavy rains have necessitated the replanting of some acres in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Chicago districts. Spring planting was progressing ahead of the average pace in several districts, and demand for agricultural products remains solid. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported strong livestock prices. Dairy prices have increased in San Francisco, and Minneapolis expects record May milk prices in Wisconsin. Boosted in part by the weakened dollar, exports have increased in the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Dallas reported concerns about a possible negative impact of the preliminary World Trade Organization rulings against cotton subsidies.
Natural Resource Industries 
Activity in the mining and energy sectors remains strong in the Minneapolis district, where oil and natural gas exploration and production increased slightly from mid-April. In the Kansas City district the number of active oil and gas drilling rigs rose slightly from the previous survey, but the expansion was limited by rising equipment costs and shortages of labor. Nonetheless, contacts in this district anticipate further increases in drilling, given the high energy prices. Meanwhile, the Dallas district saw little change in drilling activities, and its offshore activity remained weak. Contacts in San Francisco have experienced an increased demand for crude oil and natural gas and want to expand capacity, but are dealing with constraints in obtaining raw materials. Minneapolis reported that the iron ore shipping season was well under way.
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices 
Most districts indicated strengthening of labor markets. Boston, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported increasing employment, plant expansions, and plant openings across several sectors, including manufacturing, construction, freight transportation services, and healthcare services. Richmond reported soft labor demand in the retail sector but stronger demand for temporary production and distribution centers, administrative, financial, and customer service workers in recent weeks. Manufacturing employment in the district continued to expand. In Atlanta, small businesses reported rising labor demand, as did firms in the construction, services, and automotive parts manufacturing sectors; layoffs continued in the apparel and industrial chemical sectors, however. Contacts in the Dallas district reported continuing weakness in the labor market but indicated that some firms were planning to hire new employees.
District reports indicated little or muted upward pressures on wages, although the rising cost of health insurance remained a key issue. The San Francisco and Kansas City districts noted that sufficient labor availability was leading to limited wage pressures. The New York and Dallas districts reported little pressure on wages, while the Minneapolis and Boston districts saw moderate increases in wages. The New York district noted scattered reports that starting salaries were rising in some industries. In the Boston district, contacts in the retail sector expect wages to increase. Manufacturing firms kept the wage rates of new hires stable in the Cleveland district. Contacts in the San Francisco and Dallas districts noted high costs of health insurance. Contacts in the trucking and shipping sectors in the Cleveland district also expressed concerns over health insurance costs.
Consumer price increases were generally modest, but most districts reported increasing input prices, particularly of energy-related products, building materials, and steel. Retail prices in the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco districts remained generally stable and increased modestly in the Kansas City and Dallas district. Merchandise is being marked down less in the Cleveland district. Meanwhile, merchants have seen increases in vendor prices in the Cleveland and Philadelphia districts. In response to higher input prices, some businesses were able to push up prices to their end consumers in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas districts.",0,0
2004-05-31,"Economic activity increased across the nation from mid-February through early April. The growth was widespread as retail sales moved up noticeably, and manufacturing, mining, energy, tourism and services all grew. In addition, new home construction is strong in a number of districts. However, commercial real estate markets remained soft. Lending activity increased and credit quality remained solid. Conditions in the agricultural sector improved overall with higher prices for most products. Meanwhile, labor markets tightened somewhat with modest wage increases. Many districts reported modest increases in overall consumer prices, but most districts indicated significant increases in numerous commodities and input products.
Consumer Spending
Most districts saw a noticeable increase in retail sales. Boston, Cleveland and Philadelphia described sales as improving and strengthening, while sales were moderately above year-ago levels in the Atlanta, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts. Dallas, Kansas City, New York and San Francisco variously described consumer spending as brisk, solid or surprisingly strong. Meanwhile, retail sales growth moderated somewhat in the Richmond district, and consumer spending was somewhat mixed in the Chicago district. Several districts noted increases in apparel sales. Furthermore, many reports indicated that retail contacts were optimistic for growth during late spring and summer.
District reports indicated that vehicle sales were mixed. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported strong sales, and Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Richmond described recent vehicle sales as rising or improved. However, some districts noted that sales were constant or down slightly from a year ago. In the Atlanta district auto sales were described as uneven, with strong demand for light trucks and SUVs contrasted with weakness in demand for cars. Chicago, Dallas and St. Louis suggested that automobile sales were soft or slow. A number of auto dealers indicated that inventories were higher than desired.
Tourism and Services 
Tourism activity grew in several districts. Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond and San Francisco described tourism activity as brisk, solid or at high levels. In the northern part of the Boston district tourism picked up at a moderate pace after a slow start earlier in the year. Meanwhile, Kansas City said that travel and tourism were mixed, and Chicago mentioned that leisure travel was generally flat. Boston, Kansas City, Minneapolis and Richmond indicated that tourism businesses were optimistic for the summer season.
Contacts in other service businesses also noted growth in activity. Chicago and Philadelphia mentioned that information technology firms noted increased demand. Trucking and shipping businesses in the Atlanta, Cleveland and Philadelphia districts reported an increase in activity. Meanwhile, transportation in the Dallas district was mixed, with demand for air travel up, railroads running at near capacity and trucking activity soft. Service providers in the San Francisco district saw further strengthening in demand. However, Richmond reported that customer demand for services, on balance, was flat.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity increased in all the districts. New orders and production were up over a year ago. Several districts reported slow growth in capital equipment orders. Nearly all districts noted increased activity across a broad range of industry sectors, especially primary materials. Kansas City reported higher capacity utilization for most manufacturers. Most steel mills were operating at or near capacity in the Chicago and Cleveland districts. Philadelphia indicated that steel and iron supplies were limited. Orders for high-technology products increased in the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Rising material costs were a common theme across the nation, with mixed reports on the ability to pass costs along to consumers by raising prices.
Real Estate and Construction
Commercial real estate markets remained soft. Most districts described conditions as remaining weak or activity as slow. The St. Louis bank said its commercial slump appears to have bottomed out. In contrast, the New York and San Francisco districts continued to see moderate growth in commercial real estate activity.
Residential markets were strong, with some concerns about the rising costs of building materials. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York and Richmond all suggested strong sales, but Richmond noted softening in the Carolinas offset by activity in other markets. Cleveland said sales were on par with the same period last year, and Dallas referred to scattered signs of improvement. Activity slowed in the St. Louis district. Several districts reported mid-priced homes accounted for most of the activity, with recent increased activity in the high-end market.
Agriculture
Overall, agricultural conditions were good across the nation. Prices for most agricultural commodities remained strong. Chicago reported higher prices for corn, soybeans, hogs and beef, and Minneapolis noted record milk prices. Atlanta reported firm prices for vegetables, and San Francisco reported strong demand for nuts. Due to record prices, several districts indicated that farmers plan to plant more acres of soybeans this year. Atlanta, Kansas City and Minneapolis reported dry conditions in parts of their districts, and Richmond indicated that cold weather problems were hampering plantings.
Natural Resource Industries
The energy and mining sectors remained strong. Most districts reported that high energy prices have fostered more exploration and production. Dallas saw growth in onshore drilling but noted continued decline in offshore activity. Kansas City reported an increase in the energy sector from already high levels and noted the increase in drilling has led to shortages of equipment and labor. San Francisco reported high capacity utilization for oil and natural gas extraction as well as electricity generation, with scattered capacity increases. Minneapolis reported oil and natural gas exploration and production increased from early February levels and also noted accelerated progress on wind generation and some other energy projects. Meanwhile, firm prices and strong demand for minerals spurred production. Minneapolis noted iron ore mines continue to produce at capacity.
Labor Markets
Most districts indicated that hiring increased moderately. Chicago and San Francisco also noted that more firms plan to hire later in the year. In the Dallas district, jobs increased for production workers in high tech, apparel and lumber manufacturing. A New York employment agency, specializing in office jobs, reported that the labor market has continued to strengthen in March and early April, with improvement described as moderate but broad-based. Meanwhile, reports of hiring remained mixed in Atlanta, but declines in some of the weaker sectors abated. Hiring increased for temporary workers in several districts.
Wages and Prices
District reports show that increases in wages and salaries were modest; however, significant increases in the cost of health benefits were noted. In the Boston district, wages for retail positions were mostly steady, although some retailers were implementing increases of 3 to 4 percent. Salaries were relatively flat in the New York district. Overall wage increases were modest in the Minneapolis district, while health benefits remained a key issue in contract disputes. Dallas and Kansas City reported that wage increases were modest, but several employers noted that high benefit costs continued to discourage them from hiring new employees. San Francisco reported that employers have responded to the rising cost of health benefits in part by shifting some of the burden to workers.
Consumer price increases were generally modest, while district reports noted significant price increases in energy and several manufacturing and construction inputs. Kansas City indicated that most retailers described selling prices as flat and expected little change in prices going forward. Chicago and New York indicated that discounted or slowly declining retail prices were beginning to level off. Meanwhile, retailers in the Dallas district said they were beginning to have some pricing authority. Significant price increases mentioned in energy-related products included natural gas, oil and gasoline. In addition, significant increases in manufacturing and construction input prices included steel and other metals, plastics, cement, gypsum wallboard and lumber. Districts in which companies passed input price increases to customers included Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City. Retailers and manufacturers in Richmond were attempting to pass through higher input costs. Meanwhile, San Francisco indicated that the overall impact of higher production costs on final prices was limited, and contacts in St. Louis were reluctant to pass price increases to customers.
Banking and Finance
Most Federal Reserve districts reported increased lending activity. Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Richmond and St. Louis all reported increases with Philadelphia and San Francisco reporting slow increases. Atlanta and Chicago reported flat overall demand, but Chicago noted stronger activity for small business and commercial real estate loans. Mortgage activity was up in Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City and Richmond, held steady in New York, was mixed in Philadelphia and has slowed in Atlanta. Chicago, Dallas, New York and Philadelphia reported growth in consumer lending, while Cleveland reported flat activity.

Boston reported slowly growing demand for insurance in the first quarter, especially for life insurance, and noted that more demand came from overseas than domestically. New York and Philadelphia both noted strong first quarters for securities firms.",1,0
2004-04-30,"Economic activity continued to expand in January and February, according to information received by Federal Reserve District Banks. Growth was variously described as moderate in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, firm in Minneapolis, sound in San Francisco, and showing signs of accelerating in New York, Richmond, and Dallas.
Consumer spending rose in most Districts. There were gains in sales of general merchandise in January and February in all Districts except St. Louis, which reported a slight decline. In contrast to the general improvement in merchandise sales, motor vehicle sales slowed in most Districts. Tourism activity increased compared to last winter. Service sector activity has been expanding. Manufacturing output continued to rise in all Districts except Cleveland, where it has been steady. Real estate market conditions showed little change: commercial markets generally remain soft and demand for housing continues to be strong. Agricultural conditions were mixed: demand for beef appears to be recovering from the effects of mad cow disease but exports of poultry products have been curtailed by the outbreak of avian influenza. Oil and gas production remain at high levels and iron ore processing has increased. Bank lending has been growing moderately.
Employment has been growing slowly in most Federal Reserve Districts. Wages and salaries have increased slightly, but employers report substantial increases for employee health-care costs. Most Reserve Banks reported level or modestly increasing retail prices, but information received from manufacturers and other businesses indicates that commodity prices have moved up more noticeably. The largest increases have been for steel and for lumber and other building materials. Shipping charges have also risen recently.
Consumer Spending
Retail sales of general merchandise rose in most Federal Reserve Districts in January and February. Strong or strengthening sales were reported in New York, Richmond, and Dallas. Sales growth was moderate in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Retailers in Cleveland said sales met or exceeded their expectations.

Reports on retailers' inventories across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated that store stocks were mostly in line with sales. Stores were still receiving spring merchandise, but retailers were generally maintaining conservative inventory plans.
Nearly all Districts reported that auto sales slowed during January and February and compared to a year ago. The exceptions were Boston, where sales picked up in February after falling in January, and Philadelphia, where sales were about steady. Auto dealers in several Districts attributed the falloff in sales to cold or stormy weather that kept shoppers off the lots. With the slowdown in sales, dealers' inventories increased.
Tourism activity has improved. Bountiful snowfalls in mountain areas gave a boost to ski resorts, according to Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Richmond and Atlanta reported good business at beach resorts, and in New York and San Francisco hotel occupancy increased compared to last year.
Services
Service industry activity moved up in the Districts reporting on this sector. Boston and St. Louis noted increased demand for information technology services. St. Louis also indicated that demand for insurance and health-care services increased, but financial services and transportation activity eased. In the Dallas District, accounting and consulting firms were seeing increased activity compared with the final quarter of last year. In San Francisco, demand has strengthened for media, high-technology, and health-care services. In Richmond service sector business was steady to somewhat improved.
Transportation activity has increased in most parts of the country. National freight companies based in Richmond indicated their business has improved and trucking companies have seen increased activity in Cleveland and Atlanta. Trucking was said to have slowed seasonally in Dallas, but railroads in the Dallas District noted robust activity. Trucking companies reported increased costs for fuel and they said labor costs have increased as a result of recent regulations limiting drivers' hours. Nonetheless, Chicago and Cleveland indicated that sales of heavy trucks have increased.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity rose during January and February in 11 of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. The exception was Cleveland, where factory production rates were said to be steady. There were notable increases for electronic and electrical equipment in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas, and semiconductors in Boston and San Francisco. Cleveland and Chicago indicated that steel production had increased, and Philadelphia and St. Louis indicated that output of metal products had risen.

In a few industries reports were mixed. Food processors posted gains in Dallas but declines in St. Louis. Richmond District textile producers were gaining business but there were textile plant closings in the Atlanta District.

Real Estate and Construction
Commercial real estate market conditions have shown little change in most Districts. Continuing high vacancy rates, slowing leasing activity, and downward pressures on rents were reported by Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City. Conditions in major commercial real estate markets were mixed in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts. Despite the generally slack and unchanged market situation in most parts of the country, a few Districts noted some signs of improvement. In New York and San Francisco vacancies have moved down slightly and rents have begun to recover. Leasing activity has picked up in the Washington, DC area of the Richmond District.
Residential real estate markets continued to be strong in the majority of Districts.

In Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City residential real estate activity continued at high levels. In Richmond the housing market was said to have slowed recently, but builders expect activity to pick up.

Home price appreciation was characterized as steady in most Districts with the exception of San Francisco where the rate of increase was said to have slowed somewhat recently.
Agriculture
Agricultural conditions have been mixed. Good citrus crops were reported in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, although there was some concern in Atlanta that world supplies might exceed demand at current prices. Beef prices were still declining in Chicago and St. Louis while San Francisco reported that they have firmed and Dallas noted that prices and demand had not been affected as much as expected. Chicago reported increased prices for corn, soybeans, and milk. Dry weather in the Kansas City District has adversely affected winter wheat and led some cattle producers to postpone expanding their herds, and ice and snow in the Richmond District has limited grazing there. The outbreak of avian influenza has curtailed exports of poultry from the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts.

Natural Resource Industries
Federal Reserve Districts reporting on the energy sector noted generally strong, steady conditions in January and February. Drilling activity has been fairly level in recent months in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, but Minneapolis noted a slight decrease in exploration activity. San Francisco indicated that natural gas producers were operating close to full capacity. Rising worldwide demand for steel has stimulated increased iron ore production. Minneapolis reported that iron ore producers in that District were operating at full capacity and ore prices were rising.

Financial Services and Credit
In most Federal Reserve Districts lending by commercial banks grew moderately in January and February. Lending to business firms was rising in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco. In Chicago, lending to small businesses was on the rise while overall business lending was described as flat. Commercial bankers in Richmond and Atlanta said demand for business loans has been restrained as firms are reluctant to increase capital spending. Demand for personal loans, including credit cards, appeared to have eased in New York and Philadelphia, remained steady in Dallas, and increased in Chicago. Mortgage lending declined in Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco, and increased slightly in Richmond and Chicago.
Changes in deposits have been mixed. Banks in the Atlanta District have generally had steady growth, but growth has slowed in Cleveland and Dallas where bankers think investors are moving money out of bank deposits and into debt and equity market instruments. Banks in the Kansas City District indicated that their deposit levels have been steady.
Employment and Wages
Federal Reserve Districts reporting on employment generally noted modest increases in January and February. Boston indicated that temporary help agencies were placing more workers in manufacturing, software development, and government. There has been increased demand for temporary help workers in customer service and sales positions in the Richmond District, in office and health-care jobs in the Dallas District, and for a variety of jobs in the Chicago District. Employment agencies in New York indicated that they have been experiencing gradual increases in demand, and professional employment agencies in the Washington, DC area of the Richmond District have boosted their own staffs in response to increased business from their clients. San Francisco District employers in the retail, construction, and agricultural sectors have been increasing their hiring moderately.
Reports on wages indicated that increases continue to be moderate. However, the rate of increase in benefit costs continues to exceed that of wages. Medical insurance and workers' compensation insurance fees remain on the rise in most Districts, although the rate of increase does not appear to be accelerating.
Prices
Most Reserve Banks reported fairly stable or slowly rising retail prices in January and February, but accelerating increases in some industrial commodity prices. Steel prices have increased, and prices of iron ore and scrap metals have risen as well. Prices of lumber and other materials used in home building were on the rise in most Districts. Energy prices, especially natural gas, remained high in most Districts and Atlanta noted price increases for petrochemicals. Cleveland noted rising rates for shipping by truck and Chicago reported rising costs for overseas shipping, primarily due to increased costs for ocean transport.",1,1
2004-02-29,"Reports from Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the nation's economy has continued to improve since the last survey. The strongest report came from the San Francisco district, which said its economy expanded soundly. Most other districts also gave quite favorable reports, saying their economies improved, strengthened further, or grew at a moderate pace. However, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas reported only slow or modest growth, and St. Louis said conditions were mixed. Retailers and manufacturers reported that prices were generally steady despite increases for raw materials.
Holiday retail sales were generally positive across the country, and auto sales either improved or held steady in most districts. Manufacturing activity increased in nearly all districts, and New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City noted some growth in factory employment. Housing remained strong, particularly in the Boston and San Francisco districts. Commercial real estate was still weak, although a few districts reported signs of firming. Travel and tourism activity increased considerably, and gains were reported in most other service industries as well. Bank loan demand was flat or slightly lower, with credit quality generally unchanged. Energy and agricultural activity was steady in most districts, although the appearance of mad cow disease created considerable uncertainty in the cattle industry.
Along with the increase in overall economic activity, many districts reported modest improvements in labor markets. These improvements took the form of reduced layoffs or modestly increased hiring, although new hiring was still quite minimal in several districts and most types of workers remained easy to recruit. Health care and other employee benefit costs continued to rise. However, with labor markets still slack, wage pressures remained generally subdued. Retail prices were generally flat, with some districts reporting less discounting of holiday retail prices than in previous years. Manufacturers in most districts also held their selling prices steady, despite substantial increases in the prices of some raw materials such as steel and natural gas.
Consumer Spending
Reports on holiday retail sales were generally upbeat across the country, particularly for sales during the last two weeks of 2003. San Francisco gave the strongest report, saying robust sales led to considerable year-over-year gains. Holiday sales were also quite solid in the Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts. Most other districts reported more modest year-over-year sales growth, although some of these districts noted an improvement in sales at the end of December. Cleveland, on the other hand, said retailers were generally disappointed by sluggish sales during the holidays. All districts reporting on store inventories said stock levels were generally in good shape for 2004, and all districts reporting on expectations for future retail sales anticipate continued improvement in the months ahead.
Looking across product categories, sales of high-end items were characterized as especially strong in several districts, including New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Likewise, electronics and home furnishings sold well in many districts. On the other hand, sales of apparel were reported to be soft in the Philadelphia and Cleveland districts, and San Francisco noted heavy discounting at lower-priced apparel stores. Indeed, sales at discount stores in general were reported to have been below plan in several districts, including New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City.
Reports on auto sales were also generally positive, with most districts reporting either steady or improving sales at the end of the year. Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis characterized new vehicle sales as ""strong"" or ""solid"" in December, although St. Louis reported that sales of used cars were not as robust as sales of new cars. Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco all noted some improvement in vehicle sales from previous months, while Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas said sales were mixed or flat. Philadelphia noted that a seasonal slowing in auto sales resulted in a buildup of inventories, and dealers in the Cleveland district were worried about their ability to sell all of their 2003 models. Otherwise, though, districts reporting expectations for auto sales were generally optimistic about 2004.
Manufacturing
Nearly all districts reported increases in manufacturing activity in December, and several districts noted that factory employment had begun to edge up as well. Chicago reported broad-based improvement across manufacturing industries, and Dallas and San Francisco said factory activity increased in a variety of sectors. Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City noted strong orders in December, and Boston said several firms had been ""pleasantly surprised"" by recent increases in orders. Factory employment was reported to have posted modest overall gains in the New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City districts, and factory jobs also reportedly picked up in select industries or for select occupations in the Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco districts.
Looking across industries, primary metal manufacturing was said to be improving in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond districts, and production of various high-tech goods continued to rebound in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco districts due to increased capital spending by customers. Several districts also noted increases in the production of industrial machinery, building materials, and transportation equipment. On the negative side, St. Louis reported layoffs in the biotechnology, food, and tobacco industries. Petrochemical producers suffered from overcapacity in the Dallas district and continued to lay off workers in the Atlanta district. In addition, producers of paper goods in the Boston and Philadelphia districts reported some weakness.
Manufacturers across the country generally expect factory conditions to continue to improve in the months ahead, and several districts noted that capital spending in 2004 will be somewhat higher than in 2003. Much of the increased spending will go towards replacement of outdated IT and other capital equipment, but both Chicago and Kansas City reported a few firms plan plant expansions as well. Exceptions to the optimistic outlook included textile producers in the Boston and Richmond districts, who continue to suffer from excess capacity.
Real Estate and Construction
Residential real estate activity remained robust, with home sales and new construction reported to be strong in most districts. In the Boston district, home sales in Massachusetts continued to rise at double-digit rates, while housing activity in other parts of the district returned to more normal levels following boom conditions during the last two years. In the San Francisco district, home sales increased and home price appreciation remained solid. In most other districts, home sales and single-family homebuilding were reported to be holding steady at high levels. The only districts reporting some slowdown in overall housing activity were Chicago and Dallas. Contacts in the Chicago district said some easing was inevitable given the previous boom, but Dallas reported that high inventories of existing homes were becoming a concern. Both Boston and Kansas City reported that the high-end market was weaker than the entry-level market, although tentative signs of a turnaround in high-end construction were noted in Kansas City. The multifamily market remained weak in the few districts reporting on this sector, the only bright spot being a modest recovery in apartment rents in New York.
Commercial real estate activity remained weak, although there were signs of improvement in a few districts. In most districts, commercial real estate markets and nonresidential construction were described as soft with little improvement expected in the near term. Commercial builders in the Cleveland district viewed 2003 as a weak year and did not expect conditions to improve for at least the next six months. In the Chicago district, vacancy rates remained elevated in most segments of the market, and contacts saw no indication of a firming in demand at the end of the year. On a more positive note, however, a few districts reported either a pickup in activity or improvement in expectations for the future. For example, Atlanta reported that commercial construction activity was still generally weak but that leasing activity continued to improve. In the Dallas district, the office market remained soft, but contacts were increasingly optimistic that the worst was behind them. The strongest report came from the Richmond district, where contacts were highly encouraged by a pickup in leasing activity late in the year.
Tourism and Services
Travel and tourism activity improved substantially. Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco all reported a surge in visitors to ski resorts due to very good snow conditions, while Atlanta noted increased optimism about winter tourism in Florida and New Orleans. Boston also reported a positive outlook for international bookings due to the lower dollar and promotional airfares. Demand for hotel rooms in New York remained strong, as brisk leisure travel activity more than compensated for a continued slump in business travel. In other reports on business travel, Atlanta observed a modest increase in convention bookings, while Boston noted increased spending on corporate entertaining and higher bookings for corporate meetings in 2004.
Activity in other service industries generally expanded as well. Several districts reported increased demand for freight transport services. For example, Cleveland observed busy trucking activity serving retailers, Dallas reported increased rail shipments of lumber due to strength in construction, and San Francisco noted that exports and holiday imports kept several seaports operating at capacity. Looking at other sectors, Dallas reported robust growth in legal services, Philadelphia noted improved demand at marketing firms, and New York cited unusually brisk hiring for office jobs. Boston reported little change in overall demand for insurance, with slightly higher sales of long-term care products but lower revenue from large-property insurance. On a negative note, Richmond indicated lackluster activity at several business support and technical firms.
Banking
Overall demand for bank loans either remained unchanged or declined somewhat in most districts. Home mortgage lending continued to fall due mainly to lower refinancing activity. Banks in the Chicago district reported that new mortgage originations were also slowing somewhat, although such lending remained fairly strong. Demand for consumer loans fell somewhat in the New York and St. Louis districts and rose in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts. Business loan demand increased in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis districts but held steady or weakened in other districts. Banks in the Richmond district attributed the increased demand for business loans to the stronger economy and were optimistic about lending prospects for 2004. In the Chicago and San Francisco districts, banks reported more inquiries about lending terms from small businesses, even though overall business lending remained flat.
Credit quality and lending standards were little changed in most districts. Credit quality was described as stable in the Philadelphia district, although some banks reported higher defaults on consumer loans. Banks in the New York district reported fewer delinquencies in all loan categories except business loans. In the Chicago district, business loan quality improved, but home mortgage loan quality eroded slightly. The only changes in credit standards were in the New York district, where they were tightened slightly for non-mortgage loans, and in the Chicago district, where some large banks were said to be loosening standards on business loans in an effort to boost lending.
Natural Resources and Agriculture
Activity in natural resource industries generally held steady. Ore mining in the Minneapolis district continued at a strong pace, as some mines produced near capacity while other, previously shut, mines reopened. Energy activity in the Dallas district was little changed, but contacts noted continuing excess capacity in the oil services and machinery industry. Oil and gas drilling in the Kansas City district remained unchanged at levels considerably higher than a year ago, while Minneapolis reported a decrease in both oil and natural gas exploration. Looking ahead, natural gas producers in the Kansas City district plan increased capital spending in anticipation of continued strong production, but contacts in both the Kansas City and Dallas districts expect some decline in oil production in coming months.
While most districts reported steady conditions in the farm economy, the appearance of mad cow disease created substantial uncertainty in the cattle industry. Farm incomes were supported in the Chicago district by strong hog production and by rising corn and soybean prices, while incomes in the Kansas City district were maintained by high soybean prices and still-elevated cattle prices. In the San Francisco district, farmers benefited from strong holiday sales of cut flowers and Christmas trees. Crop conditions in the Atlanta and Dallas districts were reported as stable. However, farmers in some parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts continued to suffer from drought, and Richmond reported harvest and planting delays due to excessive precipitation. The emergence of a case of mad cow disease in Washington state resulted in a great deal of uncertainty for cattle ranchers. Contacts in several districts noted substantial declines in cattle prices due to foreign bans on U.S. beef exports. The uncertainty was causing ranchers in the Kansas City and Dallas districts to take a wait-and-see approach toward herd adjustments. San Francisco, on the other hand, reported that the appearance of mad cow disease was boosting sales of range-raised beef.
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
Most districts reported modest improvements in labor markets in December. San Francisco noted a pickup in hiring, Minneapolis reported more hiring announcements than layoff announcements, and Kansas City said layoffs dropped considerably. Likewise, demand for temp workers increased in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts, and Chicago said the seasonal decrease in temp employment this year was less than in the previous two years. On the other hand, hiring was said to be quite minimal in several districts. Cleveland, for example, noted that most firms still do not plan to increase payrolls in the near future. In addition, while hiring improved somewhat in the Atlanta district, firms generally remained reluctant to add full-time staff. Both Kansas City and Dallas noted some pickup in demand for high-tech workers, although such workers were still easily recruited in the Kansas City district and some types of high-tech and telecom work in the Dallas district continued to be outsourced overseas. Acute labor shortages were generally reported only for select health care fields, with some hospitals in the Atlanta district recruiting overseas to fill open nursing positions.
Wage pressures generally remained subdued throughout the nation, but most districts continued to report greater upward pressure on health care and other employee benefit costs. Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco described wage increases as ""weak"" or ""modest"" and Boston stated that wages were mostly stable. Exceptions were reported in the Dallas district, with wages subject to downward pressure in the airline industry but upward pressure in certain occupations such as skilled mechanics. Meanwhile, districts consistently reported that employee benefit costs continued to increase. San Francisco said that the improving job market was making it harder to shift increases in health care premiums to workers, resulting in slightly higher growth of total compensation.
Most districts reported little change in final goods prices, but costs of some raw materials rose noticeably. Retail prices were generally stable. Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported less discounting of holiday retail prices than in previous years, although a few other districts said holiday discounts were similar to last year. In manufacturing, the most widely cited increase in raw materials costs was for steel. Contacts in the Cleveland district said steel producers were raising prices to cover the increased cost of their own inputs, such as scrap and iron ore, and that steel prices were likely to continue rising through the first quarter. Price increases were also reported in some districts for copper and aluminum. In the Boston district, prices of lumber and plywood were reported to have fallen back somewhat from the highs reached in the third quarter, but contacts in other districts said these prices were still well above year-ago levels. In most districts, manufacturing firms were reported to still be having difficulty passing input costs on to their customers. In the Dallas district, petrochemical producers held their selling prices steady in the face of sharply rising natural gas prices, and trucking firms kept their rates unchanged despite higher fuel costs. The only signs of a change in pricing power were in the New York and Kansas City districts, where some firming in selling prices was reported.",0,1
2003-11-30,"Information received from District Banks suggests that, on balance, the pace of economic expansion has picked up since the last report. Ten of the twelve districts indicate that activity has been expanding, while two--Boston and Cleveland--report mixed but steady levels of economic activity. Overall, both wages and prices of finished goods and services remained relatively stable, though there were scattered reports of business input cost pressures. Hurricane Isabel inflicted some limited damage across much of the Richmond District, but the disruptions to activity from the storm were said to be short-lived.
Consumer spending generally strengthened, though most districts report a recent pullback in auto sales. Improving sales trends are reported in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Retail inventories are generally described to be at or close to desired levels, and retailers generally anticipate modest year-over-year gains for the upcoming holiday season. Most districts report strengthening in manufacturing activity. Employment in this sector remained generally weak, though some districts note pockets of firming.
Broad-based strength is reported in residential real estate and construction, but commercial real estate markets are still described as sluggish. Travel and tourism activity was mixed but, on balance, showed some improvement. Reports from most other service industries also show improvement.
Banks in almost all districts report a substantial drop-off in refinancing activity since the last report, though there were a few reports of improvement toward the end of September. There was some pickup in business loan demand, while home mortgage and consumer lending were mixed. Credit quality was generally described as good, with only scattered reports of increased delinquency rates. Most districts report favorable weather conditions and improved agriculture yields since the last report, though Richmond reports significant crop damage from Hurricane Isabel.
Labor markets generally remain slack, but some signs of a pickup are reported in New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Prices of finished goods were generally stable, and wage increases continued to be quite modest, though many districts note continued escalation of non-wage benefit costs--particularly health insurance. Also, fairly sharp price increases are reported for cattle and certain commodities, such as steel, lumber, plywood, and natural gas.
Consumer Spending
Most districts report a general strengthening in retail sales but some softening in automobile purchases. A few districts credit the recent federal tax rebates with temporarily boosting sales, though the timing of the effect on sales varied. Non-auto sales are generally said to be improving in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, while Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago describe sales as steady or moderating but still ahead of plan. Boston and Richmond characterize sales as flat but with some pockets of strength. Richmond reports that sales lost due to hurricane-related closures were quickly made up, and that hardware stores, grocery stores, and restaurants saw brisk business after the storm.
Recent reductions in motor vehicle sales are reported in most districts. Automobile sales are said to have weakened in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. St. Louis, on the other hand, reports some improvement in vehicle sales in recent weeks, though they were still lower than a year ago. Also, sales of imports are said to be holding up better than those of domestic makes in the St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts.
Non-auto inventories are generally reported to be in good shape in almost all districts, but vehicle inventories are said to be higher than desired in Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis. Looking ahead to the rest of 2003, retailers in most districts are reported to be cautiously optimistic. Modest sales growth is anticipated in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City, while the remaining districts did not specify sales expectations.
Manufacturing
The majority of the districts report a pickup in manufacturing activity, with several indicating significant improvement in a wide variety of industries. Machine tool orders strengthened in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts; semiconductor producers note a pickup in demand in the San Francisco District; contacts in lumber and construction related materials see improvement in several districts; and high-tech manufacturers in the Dallas District indicate gains. On the downside, Richmond reports a contraction in its manufacturing sector, and contacts in Boston report weak demand and a decline in revenues. The Minneapolis District notes only slight gains, and the Dallas and Cleveland Districts report mixed activity. Kansas City, Boston, and St. Louis report a decline in activity in the aerospace industry, and several districts indicate marked deterioration in the textile industry. Activity in the transportation equipment industry was mixed, with declines noted in the Philadelphia District, little change in Chicago, but increases in St. Louis. Several districts report a continuing low level of inventories, and most contacts report that input prices remain high, and above year-ago levels, but have not accelerated further since the last report.
Manufacturing employment exhibited modest gains in some districts, but in most was stable or declining. The Kansas City, Cleveland, and New York Districts report increases in hours worked, and Kansas City, New York, and St. Louis report hiring gains. Capital spending activity was mixed, with contacts in several districts reporting plans to increase capital spending, while the majority of contacts from other districts cite hesitation and lackluster spending plans going forward.
Real Estate and Construction
Residential real estate markets continued to show strength in virtually all districts, while commercial real estate markets remained generally sluggish. Virtually all districts describe housing markets as robust, despite relatively modest signs of slowing in the Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. On the other hand, signs of further strengthening are noted in New York, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. A few districts specify that the recent increase in mortgage rates appears to have had at most a limited impact on home sales. Reports from Boston, New York, Chicago, and Kansas City note particular strength for entry-level or lower- to mid-priced homes, as opposed to the high end of the market.
Residential construction is also indicated to be strong in most districts. Recent increases in construction activity are reported in New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Kansas City notes that builders have had trouble obtaining plywood, while reports from Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco indicate sharp increases in lumber and plywood costs, which, in turn, are said to be squeezing builders' profit margins.
Commercial real estate markets, in contrast, continue to be characterized as weak in almost all districts. Still, a number of districts indicate slight signs of firming since the last report--specifically New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas. On the other hand, renewed signs of slowing are reported from Chicago and Minneapolis, while conditions are described as stagnant in Richmond and San Francisco.
Tourism and Services
Tourism and travel activity was mixed but, on balance, improved; however, both business travel and international visitors were still lagging, although there were some scattered signs of recovery. Overall, tourism was described as robust in New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco but sluggish in the Boston District. Since the last report, New York and San Francisco report a pickup in international visitors, while Boston, Minneapolis, and Kansas City note some pickup in business travel. On the other hand, Atlanta describes both of these segments as persistently weak. Richmond reports that Hurricane Isabel caused substantial hotel damage and widespread cancellations along much of the Virginia and North Carolina shore. The evacuations from the storm resulted in a noticeable pickup in business at hotels in less affected parts of the district.
Business conditions in other service industry sectors varied but generally improved. Increased demand for various business-related services (such as legal, accounting, IT, and executive search) is noted in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco. Increases in trucking are reported in Cleveland, while Dallas indicates a decrease in trucking volume but an increase in rail shipments, and New York reports strong increases in port traffic. Boston reports mixed to firmer conditions in the insurance industry, with industry contacts reporting little financial impact from the August blackout and expressing optimism about the business outlook.
Banking and Finance
Banks report mixed but generally favorable conditions. Loan demand is generally steady overall, with some improvement from the commercial sector, but steep declines in mortgage refinancing. Demand for commercial loans strengthened in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, and was little changed in New York. While none of the districts indicates weakening in business lending, a few characterized the level of activity as still low. Demand for consumer and home mortgage loans was steady to weaker in New York, Cleveland, and Richmond, but some firming was indicated in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Most districts report sizable declines in mortgage refinancing activity, though Dallas indicates persistent strength in this category, while Chicago and Minneapolis report a slight bounceback in late September.
Loan quality is generally described as good, with delinquency rates little changed since the last report. Chicago and Dallas report some improvement in loan quality and Atlanta says that loan delinquencies ""remained manageable,"" while Philadelphia cites an increase in debt-service to income ratios, and New York indicates an uptick in delinquencies on consumer and home mortgage loans.
Aside from lending, financial institutions report favorable conditions and brisk growth. New York's securities industry reports strong growth in revenue, profits and compensation. Similarly, financial institutions in the Dallas District report a pickup in mergers and acquisition activity, leading to higher fee income. Finally, San Francisco suggests that a recent acceleration in business deposit in-flows further reflects a pickup in general economic activity.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Most districts report favorable weather conditions and improved agriculture yields since the last report. However, Hurricane Isabel wrought significant damage in the Richmond District. A combination of flooding, high winds, and power outages resulted in damage to crops, fruit, livestock, and fishing equipment in much of the Richmond District. Otherwise, recent rains have improved crop yields in the St. Louis, San Francisco, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Chicago Districts. These rains, however, caused spotty problems for fall planting in some districts. Suppliers from all cattle-producing districts report banner prices, decent pasture conditions, and are optimistic that profits will follow suit.
Activity in the energy industry was mixed. The Minneapolis District indicates a slight decline in oil and natural gas exploration levels since the last report, while the Kansas City District reports a moderate expansion in oil and gas drilling. The Dallas District reports that activity remained at a relatively high level, but was not quite as strong as might be expected given the current price of oil and natural gas.
Labor Markets, Wages and Prices
Most districts continue to describe labor markets as slack, though there are modest signs of improvement in a number of districts. In general, labor markets are characterized as stagnant in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. On the other hand, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas report increased demand for temporary workers, while New York reports a pickup in hiring across a number of sectors. Both New York and Chicago note that much of the hiring is coming from smaller firms. Kansas City notes some decrease in layoff announcements, as well as an increase in hiring plans.
Modest wage growth is reported across the nation, though continued escalation in non-wage benefits, particularly health insurance, are noted in Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Rising benefit costs are said to be holding down wage increases in the Atlanta District and deterring hiring in Dallas.
The various districts report little change in prices of consumer goods and services, but steep escalation in certain commodity prices. Retail prices are reported to be stable in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco; steady to slightly higher in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City; and steady to slightly lower in Boston, New York, and Dallas.
In contrast with the general price stability for finished goods and services, prices for a number of commodities have risen sharply. Steep increases in lumber and plywood costs are noted in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco--some of this is attributed to post-war rebuilding in Iraq, post-hurricane repairs along the Mid-Atlantic seaboard, and fires in the West that affected supply. There were also reports of steep price increases for cattle, steel, and natural gas. However, oil and gasoline prices have retreated, following a sharp run-up in August. In terms of intermediate services, a noticeable increase in freight costs is reported in the Minneapolis District, but declines in commercial rents are seen in Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis.",1,1
2003-10-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicate that the economy continued to improve in July and August. Eleven districts say that activity levels increased during the summer. In some districts, improvement occurred in selected sectors, and in others, it was broad-based. Even in the Dallas district, where activity remains generally weak, contacts are said to be more optimistic.
Consumer activity showed improvement in most districts. But Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Boston noted that the increases in retail sales were slight or modest, and New York indicated retail results were better in July than August (partly on account of the August blackout). And retail sales were weak or softening according to respondents in the Cleveland and St. Louis districts.
Ten districts report increases in manufacturing activity. The exceptions were Dallas, where there was little change, and Richmond, which reports that manufacturing weakened. District reports on nonfinancial services firms--temp agencies, software and IT companies, or trucking and shipping--mostly indicate activity increased during the summer months. Among districts reporting on bank lending, a majority cite increases. Most districts report strong housing markets and weak commercial real estate markets, with the latter showing scattered signs of improvement.
Business reports from the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas districts mention the mid-August blackout. While respondents note a comprehensive assessment is premature in this round of information-gathering, the effects were generally small. Even where firms were closed for several days, affected contacts suggest they are not anticipating difficulties in making up for lost production or shipments.
Labor Costs and Prices
Labor markets remain slack across the nation, with few reports of occupational shortages. Employers in a number of districts indicate that wage increases, when they occur, are modest, but the rising cost of benefits--notably health insurance--has raised compensation costs.
Although districts note price increases for natural gas, gasoline, insurance, tuition, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, most product prices are reported to be stable or lower, as businesses say they cannot pass along these or other cost increases to their customers. The dominant price pressures are downward according to reports from Boston, New York, and Chicago, notwithstanding a few manufacturing respondents in Boston and Chicago who indicate they have raised selected prices by small amounts; Dallas reports that manufacturing prices are falling. San Francisco cites ""very little upward movement"" in the prices of final goods and services, while Minneapolis reports that price increases are generally modest and manufacturers expect prices to remain level for the remainder of the year. Similarly, retailers in the Kansas City district expect little change in prices in coming months.
Retail and Tourism
In most districts, retail sales improved at least modestly in July and August. Contacts in New York report that sales were generally above plan in July, while August reports were mixed, with the blackout having adverse effects on some stores. Respondents in Philadelphia note that sales improved in August from July, while retail revenues are said to be down slightly in St. Louis. Reports were mixed in the Cleveland district, though sales were down compared to the same period last year.
Among categories, the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis districts report reasonably strong demand for back-to-school merchandise, with Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noting a sales up-tick particularly in back-to-school apparel. Home furnishing sales are reportedly up in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis districts. Appliance sales improved in New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
District reports on automobile sales are mixed. Contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco note rising auto sales over the summer, while sales in Dallas are said to be generally flat. Overall car sales are down compared to a year earlier in the Cleveland district, though used car sales continue to increase. Reports from contacts in Atlanta and Chicago were mixed, although both districts report a pickup in sales of light vehicles. Auto dealers in some districts have increased incentives to reduce 2003 inventory as they head into the new model year.
Travel and tourism reports are mixed for July and the first half of August. Overall tourism levels are below a year ago in the Atlanta district, but drive-to tourist destinations continue to perform better than those relying on air traffic. Manhattan hotels note fairly strong business in July and early August. Tourism was generally flat in the Chicago district, and reports are mixed in the districts of Minneapolis and Kansas City, as business in some areas was hindered by forest fires. Contacts in San Francisco report slight improvements in late July and August, with hotel occupancy rates rising in some areas.
Manufacturing and Related Services
Manufacturing activity is reported to be improving slightly to moderately in 10 of the 12 districts. New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco cite continuations of the upward trends in production or orders observed in the spring and early summer. Chicago notes widespread up-ticks in key manufacturing sectors, and Philadelphia finds that increases in shipments and orders are spreading. Most of the remaining districts characterize the improvements as selective. By contrast with the prevailing tone, Dallas says that manufacturers continue to report tough conditions, and Richmond indicates that manufacturing activity has weakened somewhat.
Various districts report solid or strengthening demand for autos and auto parts, high tech equipment, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and building materials. According to reports from Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco, the improvement in manufacturing extended to a pickup in demand for machine tools and industrial equipment. Boston notes rising demand for military goods and stabilizing demand for commercial aircraft, while St. Louis indicates that firms in the helicopter and aerospace industries are expanding. On the other hand, markets for paper, chemicals, textiles, and furniture were reportedly soft or softer than in the recent past, and overall steel demand remains muted.
Manufacturers are reportedly facing rising costs for energy and insurance, but materials costs mostly remain contained. Several districts cite new opportunities for manufacturers to raise prices or trim discounts slightly for selected products. However, competitive pressures or weak demand continue to cause other selling prices to hold steady or fall.
Manufacturing labor demand appears to be firming. A majority of districts indicate scattered reports or projections of longer work hours and selective hiring, and several report that layoffs are becoming less frequent. Most districts commenting on capital spending indicate that manufacturers' plans remain cautious, although the majority of contacts in the Philadelphia and San Francisco districts plan increases.
Manufacturers generally expect that their production volumes will increase somewhat during the remainder of 2003. However, forecasts vary by industry, and some districts indicate that their contacts are planning conservatively in light of uncertainties about the economic recovery.
Non-Financial Services
Non-financial services firms in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco districts report higher demand during the summer than a year ago. For software and information technology firms in both the Boston and San Francisco districts, revenue and employment levels were flat or slightly higher than a year earlier. In Boston, a few companies that had considered layoffs in the first quarter have, in fact, begun to hire. San Francisco technology respondents report slight demand growth, although sales of telecommunications services were soft.
Temporary employment firms in the Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas districts report modest demand growth in the second and early third quarters. Respondents said they are optimistic, believing recent improvements in demand reflect more than just seasonal trends. A large New York firm reports a lull in temp hiring in early August, but expects a rebound after Labor Day, noting that the pace of layoffs in the district has abated noticeably in recent months. The Dallas and Boston districts cite signs of increased demand for temp workers in technical areas like software, electronic assembly, and technical support.
Trucking and shipping contacts from the New York, Richmond, and Dallas districts report total volume is higher than a year ago, with a pickup in activity in July and August. Demand for transportation services improved this summer, according to reports from San Francisco and Dallas districts.
Banking and Financial Services
The majority of districts reporting on bank activity registered a modest pickup in lending in late July and August. Overall lending was up in the Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, New York and Philadelphia districts, but deteriorated in the Atlanta, Chicago and Richmond districts due to weak mortgage refinancing activity. As thirty-year mortgage interest rates hit 6 percent in August, some districts tallied mortgage lending declines, while others scored gains as borrowers reportedly hurried to secure mortgage financing in expectation of higher interest rates.
Business lending increased in the Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco districts, but Atlanta, Richmond and St. Louis saw some decline. Richmond respondents remained pessimistic about the possibility of an upturn, while Chicago and San Francisco report growing demand by small and medium-sized firms. While business loan quality generally held steady, Cleveland and New York saw slightly higher delinquency rates for commercial and industrial loans; by contrast, the quality of consumer credit remained largely unchanged across districts.
Construction and Real Estate 
Residential real estate activity remained strong in most districts in July through mid-August, with some contacts reporting all-time sales highs. Respondents in the Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts report that overall sales were strong in recent weeks. Dallas indicates that real estate markets ""improved"" in July and early August, but that the industry ""remains very competitive, restraining price increases."" In contrast to most districts, real estate contacts in Atlanta report a ""slight weakening in overall sales growth, especially at the higher end;"" some of this weakness they attribute to unusually wet weather over the summer months. Contacts in the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco districts say that the recent upturn in mortgage interest rates prompted a rush to complete sales of both new and existing homes in August. Contacts in Atlanta anticipate some continued slowing through the end of the year as a consequence of rate increases.
Although commercial real estate markets remained lackluster in most districts in July and early August, scattered signs of improvement were reported. Overall conditions are ""soft"" in Chicago, ""weakened"" in Kansas City, ""sluggish"" in Minneapolis, and ""lagging"" in St. Louis. Boston reports that commercial real estate markets are ""holding steady"" and Richmond cites ""flat"" conditions. By contrast, New York respondents note continued improvement, particularly in areas of Manhattan. Atlanta cites ""small improvements,"" and Dallas reports signs of optimism. Most districts report high vacancy rates and some edged higher, but New York cites moderate declines in vacancies, led by strong leasing activity in the Class B segment. Looking forward, contacts in several districts indicate they expect continued weakness until employment growth improves.
Agriculture and Other Natural Resources
Unfavorable weather--too much rain in the East and too little in the Midwest and Southwest--is delaying harvests and damaging crops and pastures in parts of many districts. Contacts across wide areas expect reduced yields for corn, soybeans, and small grains as well as for some more localized products. However, in the Atlanta and St. Louis districts, the corn and soybeans are reportedly in generally good condition. As a result, Atlanta growers are said to be in a position to increase exports to drought-stricken Europe. San Francisco contacts also note strong export demand. In the hot, dry weather, pastures are reportedly deteriorating and livestock is coming under stress, especially in parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts and, to a lesser extent, in the Dallas district. While contacts in Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco describe cattle prices as steady or strong, potentially boosting profits, the need for supplemental feed is rising in some areas, and bankers in the Kansas City district do not expect borrowers to fully recover recent years' losses. Similarly, while some lenders in the Minneapolis district expect above-average farm incomes in the third quarter, Chicago contacts point to lowered yield prospects and higher input costs and anticipate no improvement in farm balance sheets.
In the energy sector, contacts in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts report that oil and gas exploration or rig counts are constant, solid, or increasing slightly. San Francisco notes that widespread hot weather and the reduced availability of hydropower have reportedly driven natural gas prices higher in recent weeks, while Dallas indicates that blackout-related and other unplanned outages at refineries have caused spikes in gasoline prices. Kansas City bankers say that demand for loans for gas field equipment and development is strong, while Dallas drilling companies reportedly view prices as high enough to cover capital costs. Still, Dallas energy contacts remain intent on controlling costs and cautious about hiring. Most major iron mines in the Minneapolis district are said to be operating near capacity, but they too have announced efforts to cut costs.",1,1
2003-08-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts provided additional signs that the pace of economic activity increased a notch during June and the first half of July. Only the Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts characterized economic activity as sluggish while Atlanta described conditions as mixed. Reports from the remaining districts suggested somewhat stronger growth in the weeks since the last Beige Book. Consistent with the generally more positive assessments of current economic activity, several districts noted increased optimism about economic prospects in coming months.
In particular, manufacturing activity edged higher in most districts, and Philadelphia and Richmond cited an end to the recent declines in production. The districts' reports also suggested that activity in the services and energy sectors grew somewhat faster in recent weeks. In contrast, consumer spending remained lackluster-only New York reported a noticeable improvement in retail sales. Housing sales and starts remained strong across districts, spurred by low mortgage interest rates, but commercial real estate conditions remained sluggish. Prices were generally little changed, though higher health insurance costs continued to be passed on to employees according to some districts. In agriculture, excessive rainfall delayed harvesting and damaged crops in several districts but was credited with alleviating drought conditions in other districts.
Consumer Spending and Tourism
Retail sales were mixed across districts since the last Beige Book report. Sales improved noticeably in the New York District, while sales in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia districts, sales posted slight to modest gains. In contrast, sales revenues were said to be flat in the San Francisco District, lackluster in the Chicago District, and below year-ago levels in the St. Louis District. Among categories, apparel sales were weak in the Boston, Cleveland, and Philadelphia districts, but were higher in the New York and Richmond districts. Richmond also reported stronger sales of home merchandise, hardware, and building supplies. In the Chicago and Philadelphia districts, customers were said to be buying less expensive brands of merchandise. Retailers in the Atlanta, Dallas, New York, and San Francisco districts cited heavy discounting and noted that retail prices remained competitive. Retail inventories in the Atlanta District were described as low and balanced, but in the Dallas and St. Louis districts, some retailers reported excess inventories.
Reports on automobile sales across the districts were mixed. Sales were flat to lower in the Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts. Sales were steady in Philadelphia and Richmond, but were mixed in Atlanta. In the Kansas City District, motor vehicle sales improved in areas outside of Colorado, and Minneapolis reported that automobile sales were above year-ago levels. Contacts in several districts said new vehicle inventories were above desired levels. Dealers in the Kansas City District reported record-high inventories, but they expected the inventories would be drawn down in coming weeks.
Tourism and travel reports were also mixed in June and the first half of July. In the Chicago District, hotel occupancy rates were boosted by discounts and economy packages. Boston said that international travel more than doubled compared to last year, but the report indicated that travel industry expectations were not met because activity still trailed pre-9/11 levels. Likewise, early summer travel in the Atlanta District fell short of industry expectations even though a large cruise line in South Florida reported a recent spike in bookings and projected a robust second half. Kansas City indicated that passenger traffic rose at most airports in its District and that convention business in Denver was strong.
Manufacturing
Nascent signs of a recovery emerged in the manufacturing sector with 10 of the 12 district reports indicating mixed, steady or slightly improved conditions after an extended period of declines. Atlanta and St. Louis suggested continued softness in the sector, with both reports citing increasing plant closings and layoffs. Reinforcing the view of stronger conditions in manufacturing, nine of the twelve districts were optimistic about prospects for the sector over the next six months. Despite the stronger tone, prices of manufactured products remained soft.
Chicago's report noted that nationwide light vehicle production was ""pretty good"" through mid-July and that heavy equipment orders edged up, in part because of a weaker dollar. San Francisco reported that new orders in the information technology sector strengthened, reducing inventory levels. Suppliers to the defense and military industry in the Cleveland and Atlanta districts continued to report strong orders, while Boston and Dallas noted a pickup in demand for personal computers and computer hardware. Philadelphia added that demand increased for residential construction materials and orders rose for printing and industrial machinery components.
But weakness persisted in some segments of the manufacturing sector. Richmond and Atlanta reported that textile shipments continued to fall, Atlanta reported layoffs at an aircraft engine plant, and Boston noted weakness in the aerospace industry. Cleveland indicated that auto production fell further though the decline was smaller than in previous months. Chicago said that demand for steel remained soft and Dallas reported that energy-related manufacturing activity was softer.
On balance, capital expenditures in the manufacturing sector remained weak, although several districts reported an increase in investment planned for the future. Atlanta reported that firms remained reluctant to buy new equipment. Kansas City indicated that recent capital spending fell but that planned future investment edged up, as optimism about manufacturing prospects remained high. Boston and Dallas noted increases in capital spending for upgrades in hardware and software, while Philadelphia said that manufacturers planned to increase investment, though some firms indicated they would likely delay expansion until next year. St. Louis reported that several plants in that district have recently announced plans to expand.
Services
Ten districts reported increased demand in the service sector during recent weeks. Demand for legal services increased in the Dallas, New York, and San Francisco districts, and Philadelphia said demand for technological expertise and business consulting rose. In the San Francisco District, contacts reported stronger demand for high-tech and real estate services. Atlanta, Boston, and New York reported a pickup in the demand for finance and insurance services and the Dallas report suggested stronger corporate finance and acquisitions activity.
Construction and Real Estate
Residential real estate activity remained strong in most districts in June and early July. Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis said housing sales continued to rise while Boston, Cleveland, and Richmond reported that sales remained strong. Chicago indicated that overall sales activity was mixed. In contrast, Dallas indicated that the housing market remained weak. In terms of price levels, lower-priced homes continued to be the best sellers in the Boston, Dallas, and Richmond districts and sales of upper-price range homes held up in the Boston and New York districts. Richmond reported that home prices soared in Maryland in recent months and San Francisco said prices rose rapidly in Hawaii and southern California. However, home price increases moderated in the Boston and Cleveland districts. Residential building permits increased in the Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis districts. Kansas City said strong starts of entry-level homes offset weak starts of upper-priced homes. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco reported that low mortgage interest rates continued to drive sales in their districts.
Commercial real estate conditions remained weak in most districts during June and early July. Very little new construction activity was noted-an exception was in the St. Louis District where construction activity had begun to pick up before being delayed by inclement weather. Commercial leasing activity also remained generally stagnant, although renewals and renegotiations drove some activity in the Chicago District. In contrast to the overall sluggishness, Atlanta reported small increases in leasing and net absorption. Compared with the last Beige Book reports, vacancy rates edged higher in the Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco districts and were higher compared with a year ago in the St. Louis District. Chicago and New York reported that rents moved lower, and Richmond indicated that landlord concessions had reemerged in the office and retail sectors. However, several district reports noted pockets of improvement-leasing activity was up in the Atlanta and Minneapolis districts along with a substantial decline in vacancy rates in Lower Manhattan. Looking ahead, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Richmond, and St. Louis reported that their contacts expected the excess commercial space currently on the market to be absorbed slowly.
Banking and Finance
Lending activity was mixed across districts in June and early July, as solid residential mortgage demand was accompanied by weak demand for commercial loans. Most districts characterized residential mortgage demand as either increasing or continuing strong. Dallas reported a surge in mortgage lending because borrowers were anticipating rising mortgage interest rates and wanted to lock in the current low rates. Demand for commercial loans, however, was described as weak in the Atlanta, Chicago, and New York reports, and as declining in the Kansas City report. Philadelphia reported that bank lending to businesses had increased, but that the rate of growth remained slow as most business borrowers apparently saw little need to expand their operations.
Several districts reported little change in credit quality. Philadelphia said that credit quality was not currently a problem, but added that some banks believed a further deterioration in business conditions could lower the credit quality of commercial loan portfolios. Kansas City noted that some bankers had expressed concern that declining used car prices had lowered the credit quality of their automobile loan portfolios.
Prices and Wages
District reports suggested that price and wage inflation remained broadly in check, although increases were noted in the energy, transportation, and insurance industries. Atlanta reported that health care insurance premiums rose at a double-digit rate in June and early July. The rising costs of employee benefits, most notably health insurance and pensions, boosted non-wage labor costs in the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts. Most district reports described wage increases as minimal, and Kansas City reported that firms were providing no more than cost-of-living increases. Contacts in Dallas and Kansas City noted that rising benefit costs were being passed on to employees, and San Francisco reported that higher labor costs could restrain hiring in the near-term.
Prices charged by manufacturers were generally unchanged in Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City, but Chicago reported some firming resulting from the weaker dollar. On the flipside, prices paid for materials by manufacturers were mixed. The Boston, Cleveland, and New York districts noted stable input prices, but moderate price hikes were reported in Dallas, Kansas City, and Richmond.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Unusually heavy thunderstorms saturated wide areas of the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas districts in June and early July, damaging crops, delaying planting, and slowing harvesting activity. Atlanta reported reduced fieldwork in many areas as a result of Tropical Storm Bill. Because of the wet weather, Richmond noted that fewer acres of soybeans will be planted and that some of the wheat crop will not be harvested. Dallas said that hail damaged cotton in the Texas Panhandle and Chicago reported damage to some crops from severe storms. Despite the damage, Chicago said corn and soybeans were generally in good-to-excellent condition. By contrast, several districts noted that the abundant spring rains had beneficial effects. The rains eased drought conditions in much of the Kansas City District, returned the soil moisture to normal levels in St. Louis, and improved crop conditions in Minneapolis. Agricultural prices were mixed. The San Francisco District noted that crop and livestock prices had remained firm and that a lower exchange value of the dollar had boosted export activity. Minneapolis and Chicago, however, reported that milk prices remained soft.
Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. Minneapolis indicated that oil and natural gas exploration levels increased, while Kansas City reported that energy activity was steady in June and early July after increasing markedly during the first five months of the year. Dallas added that the level of drilling activity moved to new highs but noted that the rate of increase had slowed substantially in recent weeks, as producers tried to assess the storage situation for natural gas this summer. Kansas City reported that the end of a moratorium on new coal-bed methane drilling permits in Wyoming led to predictions of increased production of natural gas in coming months.",0,1
2003-07-31,"Although reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated some signs of increased economic activity in April and May, conditions remained sluggish in most Districts. No District report suggested that economic conditions had deteriorated since the last Beige Book. Economic activity increased or showed signs of improving in the Dallas, Kansas City, New York, and Minneapolis Districts. The Philadelphia and Cleveland reports characterized activity as mixed, while other Districts generally saw sluggish, subpar, or subdued economic growth. The unwinding of war-related concerns appears to have provided some lift to business and consumer confidence, but most reports suggested that the effect has not been dramatic.
Consumer spending remained lackluster overall. Retail sales rebounded as the hostilities in Iraq subsided, but sales remained below the level of a year ago. Manufacturing activity was mixed, with some Districts reporting signs of improvement since the last Beige Book but others still seeing declines in orders. Service sector reports, although limited, suggested sluggish activity overall. Low mortgage rates continue to stimulate residential construction and home sales in most Districts, but commercial construction and real estate markets were still weak. The energy industry continued to strengthen. Agricultural production was impaired by wet weather in some areas. Most Districts continued to report weakness in labor markets and some downward pressure on wages, although benefit costs continued to increase.
Consumer Spending
Overall consumer spending was soft in April and May. Retail sales picked up some after subdued sales in March, but most reports indicated that sales remained below the level of a year ago. A few Districts noted that retail sales did not pick up as much as expected after the winding down of hostilities in Iraq. Wet weather was blamed for having damped sales in the Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts, but the very recent wet weather had a positive effect on foot traffic and sales in the Boston District. Most Districts indicated that inventories are in line with expectations, although a few Districts said inventories were on the high side, particularly apparel.
The outlook for consumer spending was described as cautiously optimistic. The Boston District reported that most contacts are less concerned about economic uncertainties than in previous months and anticipate that sales will increase modestly in the next few months. Retailers in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts also expressed optimism about sales in coming months, noting that they are planning to hire summer help. However, contacts in the Dallas and Philadelphia Districts expressed caution that sales would not pick up significantly until employment conditions improve.
Lower selling prices were reported by the Dallas, New York, and Philadelphia Districts, and widespread promotional activity and discounts were reported by the Atlanta District. The Boston and Dallas Districts noted that retailers continue to focus on ways to reduce their costs and become more efficient--using such strategies as improving their marketing, investing in faster cash registers, and increasing the use of part-time workers.
Auto sales were mixed in April and May. Sales weakened since March in the Chicago, New York, and San Francisco Districts but improved in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Philadelphia Districts. Sales were below the level of a year ago in the Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts. Most Districts reported that dealer inventories have risen above desired levels. Some new incentives have been added, but contacts in the Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts suggested that consumers do not appear to be as responsive to the current offers as automakers and dealers had hoped.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity remained mixed. Three Districts--New York, Minneapolis, and Cleveland--reported an increase in manufacturing activity in April and May although three others--Philadelphia, Richmond, and Boston--indicated deterioration since the last report. The remaining six Districts reported little change from conditions that continued to be characterized as ""sluggish,"" ""weak,"" ""soft,"" or ""mixed."" Still, four of those Districts reported signs of improvement or optimism about future activity.
Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas noted that production related to defense and construction activity remained among the bright spots in the manufacturing sector. San Francisco noted strong demand for advanced technology production. Energy-related manufacturing activity in the Dallas District remained relatively strong.
At the same time, the Richmond District's traditional manufacturing industries--textiles and furniture--recorded particularly sharp declines in April and May. The Chicago District reported that automakers said sales of light vehicles slowed nationwide in May, and inventories remained high; Cleveland noted a sharp cutback in motor vehicle production. The Chicago and Cleveland Districts also reported that, despite an increase in demand for specialty steel, steel shipments slowed early in the second quarter. Due to limited demand for new planes by the airlines, the San Francisco District reported that production of commercial aircraft has dropped to the lowest levels since the mid-1990s.
Services
Airline traffic has steadily increased in recent weeks, according to the Dallas District but, with airline capacity abundant, expectations are for a summer with low fares and intense competition. Airlines are carrying fewer passengers than a year ago and are continuing to cut costs through additional layoffs.
The Cleveland District reported that demand for trucking and shipping was flat in May compared with April and slightly lower than one year ago. In the St. Louis District, business has picked up recently for midsize to large trucking firms because several smaller firms have gone out of business. The Dallas District reported an improved outlook for trucking companies and an increase in rail shipments. Contacts in the San Francisco District note that fears about the spread of SARS had no discernible affect on overseas shipping activity.
District reports on the temporary employment industry are mixed. In the Boston District, half of the temporary employment firms contacted reported an improvement in business in the first quarter, with demand for workers in health care and selected financial services up, but light manufacturing still weak. In the New York District, an employment agency specializing in office jobs has also seen a pickup. Temporary staffing firms in the Dallas District report that demand has steadied. However, the vast majority of temporary help industry contacts in the Chicago District said that new orders fell in recent weeks, and those in the Richmond District reported lukewarm demand for workers in recent weeks.
Reports on tourism and travel activity were also mixed. Tourism activity was soft in the Minneapolis District, declined modestly in the Richmond District, but picked up seasonally in the Boston District. In Chicago, tourism remained fairly steady, and hotel occupancy rates improved slightly in some areas. Although tourism was weaker than expected at Rocky Mountain ski resorts in the Kansas City District, summer bookings at family destinations are solid. Concerns about the SARS epidemic in East Asia reduced business and leisure travel in the San Francisco District in recent weeks. In the Atlanta and San Francisco Districts, increases in domestic tourism helped offset a decline in the number of overseas arrivals. Hotels in the Atlanta District continue to struggle because of the low volume of business travel. The Dallas District reports that hotel industry occupancy is 4 percent to 5 percent below a year ago.
Construction and Real Estate
Residential real estate markets and construction activity strengthened in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts and was still ""solid"" in the Minneapolis District. In some instances, sales growth was very strong. For example, in April and May, many homebuilders in the Cleveland District reported sales increases of more than 10 percent over the high level of sales one year ago. In some areas of the Richmond District, home sales in recent weeks displayed ""unprecedented strength,"" including real estate agents reporting their best sales growth in more than twenty-five years. However, inventories of unsold homes in late April and May were higher than a year ago in cities in the Kansas City District and were at record levels in Denver. In the Dallas District, new home building continued to lose steam, and sales of existing homes were very weak--contacts there say that it will take new jobs and increased confidence to stimulate demand for new homes.
Overall commercial real estate continues to be weak, with only scattered indications of conditions stabilizing at a low level. The Boston District has seen high and rising office vacancy rates and falling rents. Office vacancy rates have also edged up in suburban Philadelphia. Nonetheless, both Districts reported an increase in purchases of office buildings by institutional investors and real estate investment firms. New York's office market has shown signs of improving recently, after having weakened in the first quarter. Brisk leasing activity in Lower Manhattan--largely from the health sector--pushed that area's vacancy rate down sharply to its lowest level in one year. Commercial leasing and construction activity in the Richmond District was generally flat in recent weeks, but the retail sector was one of the bright spots in recent weeks.
Banking and Finance
Lending activity continued to increase, mostly for refinancing residential mortgages. The Chicago District reports that many households appear to be taking advantage of refinancing to pay down other debt, which is limiting growth in credit card balances. Business lending increased in the Dallas, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Districts, but was weak in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts and in most of the San Francisco District. The Richmond District reports no signs of a pickup in commercial lending any time soon.
Most Districts reported little change in loan delinquencies. The Cleveland District noted a few reports that credit quality had slipped, and bankers in the Philadelphia District expect commercial loan quality to slip in the second half of the year because revenue growth for many business borrowers has been weaker-than-expected. However, the Chicago District indicated that the credit quality on commercial loans was improving modestly, while the San Francisco District reported that the credit quality of bank loans was generally stable to slightly improved. A mild increase in residential mortgage foreclosures was reported in the Atlanta District, while the Dallas District reported a May spike in home foreclosures in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Banks in the St. Louis District reported that they had tightened lending standards for small firms.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Wet weather delayed spring planting and other farm activity in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts. The heavy rains damaged crops in some areas, such as in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts, where contacts expressed concerns about reduced crop quality. But the moisture was welcomed in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts, where rainfall improved the outlook for yields. Conditions remain too dry in the Dallas District, where cotton planting was delayed because of insufficient moisture to germinate seed. The San Francisco District noted that sales were strong for beef cattle and for most crops, in part because the depreciation of the dollar boosted demand. The Atlanta District reported a bumper winter wheat crop. The Chicago and Minneapolis Districts reported that milk prices are very low.
The energy industry continues to strengthen, according to the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Drilling activity picked up in response to robust demand for oil and natural gas. Contacts in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts expect drilling and related activity to continue to grow through the end of the year. The Minneapolis District reported a decline in the region's mining sector, with the closing of an iron ore mine due to financial difficulties and disruptions to production and shipments at other plants.
Labor Markets
Most District reports continued to indicate that labor markets were soft. In the Kansas City District, the pace of layoff announcements continued to ease, but layoffs continue at some large employers in the Dallas District and at some manufacturers in the St. Louis District. A few employers in Cleveland continued to report layoffs, but most indicated plans to augment or maintain their workforces. In the Atlanta District, firms are not yet hiring permanent employees but are leveraging existing staff by increasing hours and, or adding temporary personnel. In the New York District, a major employment agency specializing in office jobs reports a noticeable pickup in hiring since the last report.
District reports suggested little pressure on wages, although benefit costs continued to increase. In the Chicago District, contacts reported that many firms were instituting wage freezes and, or limiting or delaying merit increases. The Dallas District reported downward wage pressure in several industries, although some contacts said that the labor market had not eased sufficiently to allow the wage reductions they would desire. Service firms in the Boston and Dallas Districts report that downward pressure on fees has depressed pay rates. In the Kansas City District, wage pressures remained subdued, but some managers reported that their average wages had risen over the past year because lower-paid junior workers were laid off. Respondents in the San Francisco District noted very limited upward pressure on wages overall. Several Districts reported a continued rise in the cost of employee health benefits, particularly insurance.
Prices
Anecdotal reports suggest that price pressures are mixed, with no widespread inflationary or deflationary pressures. Lower prices were reported for crude oil, fuel, and some manufactured products. Prices also continue to be soft for many retail products. However, there were reports of rising cost pressures for tuition, state taxes, transportation, and all types of insurance. Natural gas prices rose, pushing up prices of most petrochemical products to record levels. The San Francisco District noted that depreciation of the dollar has led to higher costs for some imported raw materials and textiles.",1,1
2003-05-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested that the pace of economic activity continued to be lackluster during March and the first two weeks of April. Although Richmond observed continued modest growth, reports from Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized economic conditions as still mixed or soft. Since the last Beige Book, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted that the recent pace of economic activity had been slower than reported earlier. The onset of the war with Iraq appeared to have some effect on sales and spending, although it is too early to ascertain the full effect of the war on both consumer and business confidence.
Reports on consumer spending were generally weak in March, but respondents attributed part of the weakness to poor weather and the onset of war. Contacts also cautioned that year-over-year comparisons of sales for March were difficult because Easter fell in late March last year but falls in the third week of April this year. Optimism remained that the retail environment would improve within the next six months.
Most Districts continued to report weakness in manufacturing, although some pockets of growth were noted in most of the reports. Businesses continued to report a cautious attitude toward spending, and commercial real estate was reported to still be in a slump. In contrast, homebuilding activity remained strong across all Districts. Mortgage lending, buoyed by refinancing activity, remained strong, and a few Districts noted some improvement in commercial loan demand. Agriculture conditions generally improved as rain and snow eased drought conditions in several Districts. Labor markets remained soft, but some Districts noted moderating layoffs or improvements in demand for temporary labor.
Consumer Spending 
Overall consumer spending remained subdued in March. Although some of the weakness is attributable to Easter falling later this year, the onset of military action in Iraq and poor weather also had negative effects on March sales figures in most Districts. Atlanta and San Francisco, however, noted that March sales were ""near year-ago levels"" and ""largely stable on net"" respectively.
Although retail sales have been sluggish, most Districts indicated that their retailers were not concerned about inventory levels. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago reported heavy discounting or increased promotional environments. The outlook among retailers in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis suggested that at least a slight improvement in conditions would occur in these Districts before the close of 2003.
Reports regarding automobile sales in March were mixed: The Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco auto markets saw some rebound in March after slowing in February. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, on the other hand, reported faltering auto sales in March, although Minneapolis and Kansas City saw some recovery in auto sales in early April in response to manufacturers' incentives.
Travel and tourism spending strengthened in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, but slowed in the Chicago and San Francisco regions. San Francisco noted that international travel had weakened, due in part to the SARS outbreak in Asia. Dallas observed a decline in air travel due to the onset of the war and the SARS outbreak. Atlanta reported mixed conditions: Although international tourism fell in the District, the decline was offset by a successful spring break season.
Manufacturing
Nine of the twelve Districts reported slowing activity in manufacturing. New York and Dallas reported mixed conditions, and Cleveland reported flat or slightly improving conditions. In general, contacts reported lower levels of production, sales, and new orders.
Still, pockets of improvement in the industry were noted by more than half the Districts in this report. In Boston, companies producing hardware, semiconductors, and machine tools reported an increase in business activity, as did nondurable goods producers in the Cleveland District. Atlanta's defense-related manufacturers reported improving conditions, and the hiring of temporary workers in manufacturing rose slightly. In the St. Louis District, some auto parts producers were planning to expand their facilities. The energy-related sector in Dallas observed strong growth since the last report. Despite declining conditions at the time of the survey, manufacturers in the New York and Philadelphia Districts seemed optimistic that activity would improve somewhat within the next six months.
Construction and Real Estate 
Residential activity remained strong while commercial building activity continued to be characterized as sluggish. Most Districts reported high levels of residential building activity and sales. Still, some homebuilders suggested that there was a slight softening in their markets: In the Boston District, sales were being limited by supply, and in New York and Atlanta, demand for higher-end homes had eased.
On the commercial side, weakness in construction activity persisted as none of the Districts reported solid improvements in the industry. Office vacancy rates continued to climb in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and some Districts reported falling rental prices.
Banking and Finance
Home lending activity, fueled mainly by refinancing, remained strong across all Districts, but the Chicago District noted some slowing in mortgage activity. Consumer and commercial lending was generally flat, although some bankers in the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts saw slight increases in commercial loan demand. Several Districts reported growth in deposits, but New York reported a decline. Richmond noted a decline in consumer credit demand as clients were paying down their debts.
Agriculture
Recent precipitation has helped to allay fears of continued drought in the Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Farmers in the Kansas City District expected to strengthen their balance sheets if relief from drought conditions continues. Various Districts reported stable or rising commodity prices for items such as sugar cane, vegetables, cattle, cotton, tree fruits, and nuts, but prices for milk remained low. The Atlanta and Chicago Districts reported that higher energy prices have resulted in higher market prices for farming inputs, but in Chicago it did not appear to have a large effect because most farmers had negotiated contracts when input prices were lower.
Labor Markets
Most District reports indicated continued weakness in labor markets, as several Districts noted substantial layoffs in March and early April. Still, some hints of improvement had emerged: Both Cleveland and Kansas City reported fewer plans for staff reductions, while New York, Atlanta, and Dallas reported stronger demand for temporary workers. Several Districts reported a lack of upward pressure on wages, but firms continued to note substantial increases in the costs of health care and insurance.
Prices
Many Districts reported price pressures in specific segments of their economies, and no reports of widespread inflationary pressures were mentioned. In general, energy-related inputs in manufacturing saw substantial price increases in March and early April, but most manufacturers held the prices of their goods steady. Retailers noted heavy discounting and promotions, with notable drops in apparel and electronics prices.",0,1
2003-04-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally suggested that growth in economic activity remained subdued in January and February. Only a few Districts reported any notable changes from the last Beige Book. In particular, Richmond indicated that economic activity ""grew modestly"" and Kansas City noted ""some signs of strengthening;"" by contrast, New York said that the regional economy had ""generally weakened."" Many reports indicated that geopolitical and economic uncertainties were constraining consumer and business spending and tempering near-term expectations.
Consumer spending remained weak, on balance, with a few Districts noting a little improvement and others indicating a slight deterioration. Business spending was very soft, with little change in capital spending or hiring plans. Nearly all Districts indicated that real estate and construction activities were mixed, with strength on the residential side and weakness on the nonresidential side. Most Districts still described manufacturing activity as weak or lackluster, although half of the reports noted at least some degree of improvement. Refinancing activity continued to drive growth in household loans, while business loan demand remained weak. Contacts in most Districts expressed concern over rising energy and insurance costs, but noted that businesses had difficulty passing along much, if any, of the cost increases to their customers. The agricultural sector continued to be affected by poor weather in many Districts. Mining and energy extraction activity picked up, but energy production was limited by supply problems and some shortages of skilled labor.
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
Overall consumer spending remained weak during January and February. Retail sales were generally flat throughout much of the country in January. Boston, Chicago, and Kansas City reported some signs of improvement during February, but severe winter weather over the Presidents Day weekend hampered shopping in the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts. Apparel sales were mostly weak, although discounting helped move merchandise in some areas. Reports on home furnishings were mixed. Valentine's Day merchandise sold well in a few Districts, and terrorism fears boosted the sales of duct tape, plastic, and other hardware goods in some regions. Retail inventories were generally low and in line with both current sales and merchants' conservative near-term expectations. New light-vehicle sales were down from year-end 2002 levels; new vehicle inventories were high for some product lines, and incentives remained elevated. Tourism and travel reports were mostly favorable. Richmond said that tourist activity strengthened. Atlanta reported a gradual improvement in overall tourism and continued strength in cruise activity through Florida ports. Kansas City noted that traffic to Rocky Mountain ski resorts remained solid. San Francisco reported that domestic and international travel to Hawaii improved, but was below expectations.
Business Spending 
Business spending remained very soft, as geopolitical concerns and uncertainty over the strength of demand continued to constrain spending and hiring plans. Capital expenditures remained sluggish, with most Districts noting little change in recent months. Cleveland and Atlanta noted particular weakness in manufacturers' current capital outlays. Boston and Chicago reported that information technology spending was weak, with Boston noting further softening, particularly for telecom-related software and services. By contrast, Dallas indicated a slight improvement in information technology sales, with one contact noting an increase in orders for replacement hardware such as routers, computers, and monitors. While businesses in much of the country remained cautious about their plans for capital spending in coming months, a survey of Philadelphia District manufacturers indicated that about 25 percent of respondents planned to increase outlays while only 10 percent planned decreases. Reports of demand for legal and accounting services were mixed, while three Districts indicated some softening in advertising.
Most Districts reported that businesses were still very cautious about hiring permanent workers, though Cleveland and Atlanta noted a pickup in the use of overtime and part-time employees. Nearly half of the District reports suggested that manufacturing industries were reducing their payrolls, and two said that retailers were downsizing as well. State fiscal woes were cited as contributing to layoffs in the Minneapolis and Kansas City regions. Staffing services firms generally continued to report soft demand. A large employment agency in New York noted that hiring for midlevel office jobs had been on the rise late in 2002, but had since dropped off. However, Dallas reported improved demand for temporary workers in administrative, light industrial, and professional and technical positions, and Richmond saw scattered increases in manufacturing.
Construction and Real Estate 
Nearly all Districts indicated that real estate and construction activities remained mixed, with strength on the residential side and weakness on the nonresidential side. New and existing home sales remained strong in nearly all Districts, with only Dallas reporting that activity was soft. Housing demand generally appeared to be strongest for low- and moderate-priced units. Demand for higher-priced homes remained softer, although Richmond and Chicago noted slight improvement in some areas. None of the Districts reported a general improvement in commercial real estate markets, and three suggested slight deterioration. Most regions said that net new demand for office space remained very weak. Vacancy rates continued to rise somewhat and downward pressure on rents persisted. Philadelphia and Richmond indicated that office-leasing activity picked up as existing tenants renegotiated with landlords for lower rents and/or concessions. Boston also reported an increase in leasing activity, largely due to consolidations. Cleveland noted that state and local fiscal difficulties were having an impact on public construction projects, and St. Louis reported that several announced hospital, church, and college projects have been delayed due to economic uncertainty. Most reports suggested that there were few, if any, expectations of a near-term improvement in commercial real estate and building activities. Cleveland, however, noted an increase in demand for architects' services, which contacts suggested could be a precursor to increased commercial building activity.
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity generally remained weak nationwide, but half of the reports noted at least some degree of improvement. Richmond indicated that ""activity strengthened"" as ""shipments and new orders rose sharply,"" and Kansas City said that ""activity improved slightly."" Only St. Louis suggested a slight deterioration, with increasing reports of weak sales. Light-vehicle production nationwide was flat-to-down from a year earlier, and adverse weather in mid-February led to some plant shutdowns in the Cleveland District. Reports from vehicle parts suppliers were mixed. Firms in the St. Louis District reported diminishing orders for automobile parts, but Atlanta suggested that businesses supplying parts to the new vehicle assembly plants in the region were outperforming other manufacturers. Demand for some high-tech goods was said to be improving. Conditions in the semiconductor industry appeared to improve in the Boston and San Francisco Districts. Dallas added that there was an increase in the demand for some high-tech consumer goods. Apparel makers in two Districts reported better conditions. Manufacturers' inventories of finished goods and raw materials were generally lean, as contacts across the country expressed high uncertainty about the near-term outlook.
Banking and Finance 
Lending activity was mixed by market segment. Most Districts indicated that growth in household lending continued to be driven by very strong residential mortgage demand. Refinancing was again spurred by lower fixed-rate mortgage interest rates; one contact in the Richmond region indicated that every 1/8 percentage point to 1/4 percentage point drop in mortgage rates brings in new people. Demand for other types of consumer loans was generally flat-to-down. A few Districts noted slight increases in delinquencies and defaults on some household loans, while one reported slight improvements in loan quality. Standards for household loans were largely unchanged. However, bankers in the Dallas region said that the quality of loan applicants was lower, and Philadelphia suggested that marginal borrowers were finding it more difficult to service their debts.
Business lending activity remained weak in most of the nation, as many bankers suggested that decisionmakers were reluctant to borrow in the face of continued uncertainty surrounding geopolitical and economic conditions. Atlanta reported that the bulk of commercial lending activity was driven by businesses refinancing existing loans. However, bankers in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts saw slight increases in some commercial lending segments. Bankers in one-third of the Districts reportedly tightened standards on some business loans. There were few indications that overall quality on commercial loans had changed in recent weeks, although bankers in the Philadelphia District noted ""some slippage in credit quality,"" while Chicago bankers suggested modest improvement.
Prices and Employment Costs 
A combination of geopolitical uncertainties, very harsh winter weather in the eastern half of the country, and lean inventories led to significantly higher energy costs in January and February. These cost increases were having wide-ranging economic impacts throughout the country--higher raw materials costs for manufacturers, increases in transportation and shipping costs, fuel surcharges, and even job cuts in manufacturing in the Atlanta region. Dallas reported that ""gasoline prices at the pump reached the highest February level on record,"" while one Chicago contact suggested that small freight haulers may be driven into bankruptcy by very high diesel fuel prices.
Upward wage pressures remained generally subdued in nearly all Districts, but some nonwage costs continued to rise, particularly for health and other insurance. Minneapolis reported that two large unions had agreed to pay a portion of their health insurance premiums in order to get 3.75 percent pay raises in each of the next two years.
Few firms said they were able to pass along much, if any, of these cost increases to their customers. Competition from both domestic and foreign producers helped keep final goods prices in check. Most Districts suggested that price pressures at the retail level remained largely subdued, with many merchants still resorting to heavy discounts to move merchandise.
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural activity remained mixed across Districts. San Francisco reported that the decline in the value of the dollar gave a boost to agricultural exports. Farmland values in the Chicago District posted the largest year-over-year gain since 1997. Higher prices for many agricultural commodities boosted planting, notably for winter wheat in part of the Minneapolis District. Cotton yields hit a record in Texas, and cotton plantings in the mid-South are expected to be higher this year. Increased livestock prices have eased profitability concerns, though reduced herds due to drought could lead to a smaller calf crop this year. The drought reportedly affected agriculture in nearly half the Districts, increasing the need for timely precipitation in the spring. On the other hand, Atlanta and Dallas reported favorable moisture levels. Cold weather had a negative impact on agricultural activity, stressing livestock in several regions, slowing field work in the Richmond District, and causing moderate frost damage in portions of the Atlanta District. Low prices continued to affect the dairy industry, even the most efficient producers. Financial stress has increased in the Chicago District, but few significant farm loan portfolio problems were reported by bankers elsewhere.
Due to higher prices, activity in the energy sector increased, though not evenly. Kansas City and San Francisco reported strong oil and natural gas activity. However, Dallas noted only a mild increase and Minneapolis said energy activity was mixed. Current and potential disruptions to crude oil supplies continued to hamper refining, especially in the Dallas District. Dallas also reported that activity was held down by industry perceptions that the oil price increase was temporary and by a shortage of trained workers. Higher metal prices helped spur mining activity in the Minneapolis District.",1,1
2003-02-28,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated subdued growth in economic activity from mid-November through early January, with little change in overall conditions relative to the last survey period. Most Districts characterized growth as ""sluggish"" or economic activity as ""soft"" or ""subdued."" The weakest report came from Dallas, where economic activity ""remained anemic."" As in the last survey, conditions in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts were more favorable overall than in other Districts, with each, especially New York, describing various signs of improvement.
Reports on consumer spending were consistently weak, with disappointing holiday sales that, in nominal terms, mostly were at or below last year's levels. Automobile sales surged at year-end in response to favorable sales incentives. Manufacturers expanded production a bit on balance, with notable gains for defense-related and biomedical products. Providers of nonfinancial services saw little change in existing weak demand, and business travel remained slow, although there were some reports of improved performance in the tourism sector. Home sales and residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some areas, and the widespread overhang of commercial real estate persisted. Agricultural production was hampered by adverse weather in some areas and performance was mixed. Extraction activity in the energy sector responded very little to sharp increases in energy prices. Bank lending continued to expand in most Districts due to strength in consumer and real estate borrowing. Labor demand was mostly flat, and despite rising costs for employee benefits and some inputs, increases in employee compensation and final prices were held down by competitive supply conditions.
Consumer Spending
Most Districts reported disappointing retail sales revenues during the survey period, with holiday season spending that was flat or down a bit compared with spending in the previous year. In Cleveland, sales were ""very poor,"" with most respondents reporting declines of 1 percent to 10 percent from year-earlier levels; San Francisco reported ""lackluster"" sales that were ""well below [retailers'] expectations."" Most other Districts saw flat sales, although Richmond and Minneapolis noted scattered reports of solid sales growth, largely due to strength in post-Christmas purchases. A relatively short holiday season and inclement weather in some areas played small roles in holding sales down.
In most areas, sales were stronger at large discount chains than at traditional, higher-priced department and specialty stores. Consistent with these observations, substantial discounting on holiday retail sales items was reported in all Districts, with Chicago explicitly noting deeper discounting compared with a year earlier. New York and Philadelphia reported moderate accumulation in retail inventories, but other Districts reported generally balanced inventories, due to a combination of conservative planning and the dominant role of low prices rather than low sales volume in determining weak nominal sales revenues.
Among product lines, the strongest holiday sales were recorded for consumer electronics and toys. Automobile sales showed signs of weakening in some areas, but according to Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago, favorable year-end financing and price incentives produced a sales flurry in late December, lifting overall sales to high levels for the survey period.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing sector continued to struggle with weak demand and excess capacity, although, on balance, slight improvement was evident. The strongest report came from New York, where manufacturers statewide reported increases in new orders, shipments, and hours worked and were ""overwhelmingly optimistic"" about the near-term outlook. Overall activity was flat to up slightly in most other Districts. However, Kansas City reported weakened activity in December after signs of stabilization earlier, and St. Louis reported widespread announcements of employment cuts among manufacturers of durable and nondurable products.
Demand for high-tech products was flat or improved a bit in Dallas and San Francisco, with the latter reporting increased sales of semiconductors for use in wireless technologies. Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco cited sales gains for pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and defense-related equipment. Manufacturing activity increased slightly in the Minneapolis District, with expanding capacity and production levels reported in the heavy machinery, metals, and electronics sectors. Automobile manufacturers in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts faced mostly stable demand, with a sales surge at the end of the year helping to bring inventories down from November's excessive levels. Declines in construction-related manufacturing were reported in Chicago and Dallas, and Richmond reported weak demand conditions for apparel manufacturers.
Most Districts reported little or no increase in capital spending by manufacturers. Atlanta noted declining demand for capital goods, and Kansas City indicated that capital spending fell in December after having firmed in October and November. Looking ahead, Philadelphia reported that the number of firms intending to boost capital spending in the first half of 2003 fell recently, and capital spending among manufacturers in the San Francisco District is being held down by excess capacity that is expected to persist for six months or more at the current pace of expansion.
Nonfinancial Services
Demand for business and professional services was somewhat weak and, overall, exhibited little change from the previous survey period. Philadelphia and Richmond described overall demand for services as ""flat"" or ""steady."" Dallas noted slow demand for accounting and legal services, and in the San Francisco District demand for advertising and related media services was soft. Boston reported good sales and revenues for insurance companies but noted that poor investment results kept hiring and capital spending frozen. Demand for trucking services remained strong in the Cleveland District despite a slowdown in December that was larger than the usual seasonal lull, and St. Louis reported steady demand for trucking but uneven profits due to rising fuel costs. Relative to seasonal norms, hiring or planned hiring of temporary service workers was slow in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas. By contrast, New York reported ""brisk,"" broad-based hiring of temps in December.
Performance indicators in the travel and tourism sector were mixed. New York reported higher hotel occupancy and room rates compared with a year earlier. In the Atlanta District, hotel bookings in tourist areas have climbed back near their levels from the year 2000, although convention business in Atlanta has been hampered by persistent weakness in business travel. Atlanta and Richmond indicated that travelers are delaying travel plans to an unusual degree, and New York noted that recent figures on advance ticket sales for Broadway theaters were running 15 percent below a year earlier. Because of favorable weather conditions, early season ski receipts were excellent in the Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. However, Richmond reported weakened tourism in coastal areas, and Minneapolis reported sparse snow and a slow start to its winter sports season. In the San Francisco District, hotel occupancies have returned to normal in Hawaii but have been low elsewhere. Demand for airline services generally remained weak, although Dallas noted that holiday travel for some airlines was better than expected.
Real Estate and Construction
Residential construction activity and home sales remained at high levels in most Districts, although there were numerous reports of slight cooling in market activity. Reported activity was strongest in the Richmond District, where growth in home sales remained strong and the housing market was described as ""tremendously active."" Market activity was down somewhat in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, due in part to normal seasonal slowing. St. Louis indicated that home demand may be leveling off. In Atlanta, home sales fell in December after an increase in November. Construction activity was at ""low levels"" in the Dallas District, although lower-priced homes (below $250,000) sold ""briskly."" Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago also reported stronger demand for mid- and entry-level homes and condominiums than for more expensive residences.
The markets for commercial real estate continued to exhibit substantial slack in all Districts. Richmond and St. Louis described demand for office and industrial space as ""sluggish"" or ""slow,"" while office vacancy rates increased slightly in Minneapolis-St. Paul, the city of Chicago, and parts of the Kansas City District. In the Cleveland District, commercial building activity remained at low levels, but builders reported a significant increase in the number of prospective projects. Minneapolis reported low vacancy rates for retail space and a corresponding increase in planned retail construction. Although San Francisco reported a decline in office vacancies in Los Angeles, contacts from that District and Dallas expect little overall change in commercial construction activity over the next two years.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Agricultural output and performance was mixed across Districts, as adverse weather conditions hampered agricultural production activity in some areas. Chicago reported high yields and high prices for a variety of crops. There and in the St. Louis District, the value of farmland rose markedly, and bankers in the Kansas City District reported good credit quality for their farm loan portfolios. San Francisco noted improved sales of agricultural products, due in part to increased overseas demand spurred by the weaker dollar. By contrast, Minneapolis reported deterioration in performance in the agricultural sector. Moreover, heavy rain and otherwise inclement weather limited yields and production activity for a wide variety of crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, while lack of moisture is likely to limit yields for the winter wheat crops in Minneapolis and Kansas City.
Activity in the energy and mining sectors was flat or up slightly on net. Mining activity in the Minneapolis District continued at high levels. Minneapolis and Kansas City reported no change in extraction activities for oil and natural gas, and Dallas reported only a slight increase, despite a sharp rise in the prices of oil and natural gas. In addition, Dallas noted that inventories of natural gas and crude oil were well below year-earlier levels.
Financial Services and Credit
Loan demand was up on net, mainly reflecting strength in consumer and real estate lending. Business loan demand remained somewhat depressed in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts, and it fell further in Dallas. Kansas City reported a slight weakening in all loan categories and tightened credit standards. By contrast, Philadelphia reported modest increases in all categories. Contacts in New York and St. Louis saw a pickup in commercial and industrial loans, with New York reporting tightened credit standards for that category. Household loan demand remained strong in most areas, especially for home financing. However, household loan demand fell a bit in Atlanta, and both demand and quality were quite weak for household loans in Dallas.
Employment and Wages
In most Districts, firms remained very cautious in their hiring decisions and most categories of labor were in ample supply. Continued layoffs in a variety of industries were reported in several Districts, most notably St. Louis and San Francisco. The labor market in New York was described as ""slack"" overall, despite a reported increase in hiring of temporary services workers. Among Districts, only Minneapolis reported some tightening in labor markets. In Cleveland, labor markets were ""stable."" Upward wage pressure was described as ""subdued"" in Chicago and Kansas City and restrained by a weak labor market in San Francisco. Minneapolis reported modest wage increases (about 2 percent) compared with a year earlier, and Boston noted that some firms plan to ease restrictions on pay increases in 2003. Kansas City noted that the only categories of labor in short supply were health-care workers and some construction tradesmen, and Atlanta reported double-digit yearly wage increases for hospital workers. Contacts in Atlanta and Minneapolis cited sharp increases in employer costs for employee health coverage. Chicago and San Francisco reported that firms are responding to increased health costs by passing on a portion to employees through rising direct contributions or reductions in other components of compensation.
Prices
Despite rising costs for energy and other inputs, upward movement in the prices of final goods and services was quite limited. Chicago noted rising input costs for steel, packaging, and electronic components, but pointed to ""fierce competition"" as the main factor holding down prices for final goods. Kansas City also pointed to rising materials costs for manufacturers, although it noted that steel prices fell recently and prices of finished goods continued to decline. Several Districts reported a sharp increase in fuel costs in December. As noted by Dallas, however, stiff competition limited the impact of rising energy costs to reduced profit margins on some intermediate goods rather than increased prices of final goods.",0,0
2002-11-30,"Most districts reported that economic activity remained sluggish in September and early October. Retail sales were weak across the nation, including some declines in motor vehicle sales from very high levels. Most districts noted that manufacturing activity had declined or grown more slowly. Home building and residential markets were generally upbeat. Commercial real estate markets softened. The agricultural sector was mixed; many areas were hurt by drought, but other regions reported ideal growing conditions and bountiful harvests. The energy sector had slowed, and mining activity was uneven. Labor markets were lackluster in all districts. Overall wage and price increases were moderate, but significant price increases were noted in health care, insurance and shipping. Most districts reported strong consumer loan demand and weak commercial lending activity. Credit quality deterioration was reported in some districts. 
Consumer Spending All districts noted weak retail sales in September and early October, while 
tourism activity was mixed. In the Cleveland, Minneapolis and Philadelphia districts, retail sales declined during September. Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City and San Francisco reported that sales growth had slowed. In the New York district, retail sales were below plan. Clothing retailers noted slow sales in St. Louis. Retail establishments gave varied reports in the Richmond district, while sales were near low year-ago levels in the Atlanta

district. Boston reported a modest pickup in sales in September after experiencing flat to declining sales during the previous two months. 
Motor vehicle sales generally slowed from very high levels. September and early October auto sales decreased in the Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Minneapolis and Philadelphia districts. Cleveland, St. Louis and San Francisco reported that sales grew more slowly. However, vehicle sales were mixed in the Richmond district and were slightly higher than a year ago in the Kansas City district, although auto dealers there expressed uncertainty about future sales. 
Tourism activity was mixed. Fall tourism was solid in several parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts but was uneven in the Chicago and Richmond districts. Meanwhile, most reports from the Atlanta district's hospitality and tourism sector were more downbeat than previously indicated, and travel demand was sluggish in most areas of the San Francisco district. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity decreased or grew more slowly in September and early October for most of the districts. ""Tough,"" ""stagnant,"" ""sluggish"" describe manufacturing 
conditions in many districts. Richmond reported that shipments, new orders, capacity utilization and employment all declined. Dallas indicated weakened activity in all manufacturing industries. Chicago noted weak demand for heavy equipment. However, the St. Louis and Minneapolis districts reported slight increases in manufacturing activity. Many districts reported reluctance of manufacturers to undertake capital spending. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Home building and residential real estate activity was positive, although softening was noted in some regions and in the higher end of the market. Chicago and Minneapolis reported overall strong home building activity. Residential real estate markets in the Boston, Kansas City and San Francisco districts were strong overall, but contacts noted slowdowns in some areas. While growth in home sales slowed somewhat in the Richmond district, residential real estate remained upbeat. Little changed for home builders in the Cleveland district. Residential real estate markets in New York showed signs of softening, particularly at the upper end of the market. The demand for higher- priced homes was weak in the Atlanta district, and activity in the single-family market tapered off in the Dallas district. 
Commercial real estate and construction activity softened in several districts. Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco reported weak conditions in commercial real estate markets. Commercial realtors reported generally flat leasing activity in the Richmond district. While office vacancy rates rose in Dallas, public projects remained a source of strength. In New York, commercial real estate markets were mixed. The demand for commercial real estate was very high in St. Louis; however, construction was slow. 
Agriculture 
The agriculture sector showed mixed results during September and early October. Dallas and San Francisco reported favorable conditions. San Francisco noted that yields 
iv 
and sales of fruits, vegetables and nuts were high. Meanwhile, Atlanta, St. Louis and Minneapolis reported varied conditions. Atlanta reported that Florida citrus and sugar production benefited from adequate rainfall and warm temperatures, but excess moisture hurt soybean production in Louisiana and Mississippi. Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago and Kansas City reported deteriorated conditions primarily due to drought. 
Natural Resource Industries 
Energy exploration activity declined, while mining activity varied. Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas reported weak drilling activity for oil and natural gas, but 
contacts in Kansas City and Dallas anticipate some pickup in the near term. Meanwhile, Minneapolis indicated mixed results in mining. 
Labor Markets 
Labor markets were lackluster, with only a few reports of increased hiring. Employment demand softened somewhat in Chicago and Minneapolis. In New York the overall market was sluggish, while Atlanta and Boston noted mostly flat employment levels. Labor markets were slack in Kansas City; however, Richmond and Philadelphia reported increases in demand for temporary employment. St. Louis reported fewer layoffs by manufacturers, but some noted that they planned to hold off on new hiring. 
Wages and Prices 
Increases in wages were generally subdued. Wage pressures remained virtually nonexistent in the Kansas City district. Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco reported 
little upward pressure. In Dallas, contacts in the temporary services industry noted downward pressure on wages. Wages increased 3 percent to 4 percent in the Boston district. 
Overall prices were reported as stable, with significant increases noted in health care, insurance and shipping. Vendor and selling prices remained steady in Boston. San Francisco and Minneapolis reported little upward pressure on prices. Boston and Atlanta indicated decreases in lumber prices. Retailers in the Chicago and New York districts noted little pressure on prices. Some districts, however, reported price increases. Health care costs continued to escalate in the Atlanta district. Significant insurance cost increases were noted by Dallas and Minneapolis. San Francisco and Minneapolis reported increased shipping prices, due in part to the work stoppage at West Coast ports. 
Financial Services 
Most districts noted that consumer lending demand, especially residential, was strong, while commercial lending demand was weak. Some districts indicated slight credit quality deterioration. Most districts reported very strong demand for home refinancing. Meanwhile, Boston reported that life insurance companies continued to see strong demand. However, most districts indicated low commercial loan demand. For example, Richmond reported that businesses reduced borrowing due to an uncertain economic environment. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago and San Francisco reported a slight deterioration in credit quality in some sectors. Philadelphia noted recent deterioration in credit quality of consumer loans, and San Francisco indicated increasing delinquencies and loan defaults in some markets.",1,1
2002-10-31,"District reports suggest that the growth of economic activity has slowed in recent weeks, with 
a good deal of variation across sectors. Although Atlanta and San Francisco reported modest improvement, most Districts indicated slow and uneven economic growth, with mixed or scattered experiences across sectors of the economy. Boston and Dallas reported little change in the overall 
level of economic activity. Retail sales were generally mixed, although seven Districts reported strong sales of home 
furnishings or appliances. Three Districts attributed slow apparel sales to unseasonably warm 
weather. Back-to-school supplies were reported to have sold well in three Districts, although another 
District reported disappointing sales. All Districts noted that retail inventories were at desired levels, 
with some reporting that inventories are being kept leaner than in the past. Almost all Districts 
reported an increase in auto sales over 2001 levels, mostly due to aggressive financing and rebate 
incentives. 
On the whole, manufacturing activity was sluggish, with a good deal of variation by industry and region. In particular, some Districts reported weakness in the high-tech and building materials industries, although other Districts reported strength in the auto and steel industries. The strength of the tourism sector varied across the Districts, with six indicating an increase in business and four reporting low or mixed activity. Almost all Districts noted that business travel has remained at a low level. 
Most Districts reported little or no gain in employment in July and August, although three 
noted that the demand for temporary workers has strengthened. In most Districts, the prices of inputs

ii 
and final goods increased slightly or remained flat. Despite few signs of pressures on wages, there was widespread concern about the effect that rising health care costs might have on labor costs. 
Nearly all Districts reported strong residential sales and construction activity. On the other hand, commercial real estate markets remained weak. Banks in all Districts report strong demand for residential mortgages and refinancing, although business lending continued to be weak across the board. Credit quality was described as good and delinquency rates as either stable or declining. 
Drought conditions have been adversely affecting crops and livestock through most of the West and large areas along the East Coast. The experience elsewhere was more mixed, with yields severely reduced in some areas and near-record levels in others. Oil prices have risen while natural 
gas prices have been largely unchanged. Natural gas inventories are expected to be at record high levels when the heating season begins. Consumer Spending 
The retail sales picture was mixed for the nation as a whole in July and August, with some Districts posting declines in sales and others noting slight gains over 2001 levels. Home furnishings and other home products were strong sellers in Kansas City, Atlanta, St. Louis, Cleveland, and New York. Some Districts noted robust sales of back-to-school items while others have been disappointed with sales so far. San Francisco and Boston reported strong demand for large appliances. Several Districts, including Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia, noted that warm weather was responsible for sluggish sales of fall apparel; others reported that apparel sold well. All Districts noted that retail inventories are in line with expectations, although a few heard that retailers are maintaining leaner inventories than in the past. Chicago, Dallas, and Boston reported that discount stores have continued to register stronger sales than general merchandisers. While Minneapolis noted that mall traffic was 
strong in August, other Districts reported a drop-off. Overall, retailers are cautiously optimistic about the fall, expecting sales to be flat or slightly up from their 2001 levels. 
Almost all Districts reported an increase in auto sales over 2001 levels, mostly due to the aggressive financing and rebate incentives offered. Inventories are at desired levels for most contacts, although many dealers are clearing out 2002 models to make room for 2003 models. Most Districts report that dealers are optimistic about sales for the next few months. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity 
Reports of manufacturing activity indicate that there was little to no growth in July and August, although Atlanta and St. Louis reported modest improvement. Some industries have struggled with sluggish orders while others have experienced moderate gains. Although several Districts noted that overall orders in the high-tech industry are still weak, demand for semiconductors has continued to improve in Dallas and San Francisco. Boston and Cleveland reported that residential appliance activity was up. While Philadelphia reported strong demand for construction materials, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Atlanta have seen declines in demand for these products. According to contacts in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland Districts, activity in the steel industry continued to increase. These Districts, along with Atlanta, also saw higher production of automobiles and automobile components. Richmond and Atlanta saw increases in orders and shipments of packing materials. New York reported a mild rebound in manufacturing activity in August after a dip in July, while the Kansas City manufacturing sector saw fewer signs of improvement in July and August. Several reports noted that positive attitudes still prevail, but manufacturers have become less optimistic than they were earlier in 2002. 
Reports from the tourism sector were also mixed across Districts. St. Louis, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Kansas City, Chicago, and New York reported an increase in business, while Boston, 
iv 
Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Richmond observed low or mixed overall activity. Most Districts noted that the duration of leisure visits has declined and that visitors are spending less money per trip. Almost all Districts noted that the level of business travel is low, as is demand for air travel, which has been affecting hotel occupancy rates in some areas. Dallas reported that auditing activity was strong, as was the demand for some legal services. The Atlanta District noted that Mississippi gaming activity has been strong. Boston reported that the temporary employment industry and the majority of software and information technology services have seen flat-to-modest increases in sales and revenue this summer. Trucking firms in Maryland and North Carolina reported soft demand. Labor Markets and Prices 
Labor markets in several Districts - Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis - showed little change since the last Beige Book. In New York, hiring remained sluggish, although some signs of a pickup were noted for August. Firms in Kansas City expressed little interest in new hiring as they wait for further signs of improvement in the economy. Many contacts in Chicago indicated a downward trend in the demand for workers in the retail sector while retail payrolls in Boston and Richmond held steady. Manufacturers in Richmond and St. Louis reported little new hiring, although one manufacturing contact in Chicago reported a modest increase between June and July. The majority of manufacturers in Boston expect only small changes in employment for the rest of 2002. The Boston and Richmond markets for temporary employment experienced stronger demand in recent weeks. In Dallas, call centers and light industrial and manufacturing firms have the most need for temporary labor. Overall, wages were reported to be flat, with virtually no reports of upward pressure on wages. Contacts in San Francisco, however, reported an abundant supply of labor and flat-to-slightly elevated wages. 
Prices, too, remained unchanged, on average, although Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and Boston reported an increase in steel prices. Prices of inputs and final goods increased slightly or remained flat in most Districts. The prices of building materials were said to be up in Atlanta, although San Francisco and Kansas City reported that these prices remained low in July and August. In almost all Districts there was concern about the rising cost of health insurance, which is leading some businesses to have higher labor costs. Real Estate and Construction 
Despite the weakness in commercial markets, most Districts, except for Dallas and Philadelphia, reported strong residential sales and construction activity. Contacts in Richmond and Cleveland attributed this vigorous activity to a favorable interest rate environment. In the Atlanta District, strong sales in some Florida markets have created a shortage of homes. July saw the highest number of monthly home closings for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in five years. Existing home sales for July and August picked up in some Chicago markets. Prices for single-family homes in New York and Minneapolis were up in the second quarter from a year earlier, but apartment rents were reported to be lower than a year ago. Philadelphia and Dallas are the only Districts reporting less than robust residential sales. Real estate agents in Philadelphia reported an easing in the rate of sales in both new and existing homes for July and August. Total home sales remained unchanged in Dallas. Homes priced below $150,000 in Dallas continue to sell, but sales for higher-priced homes are slow. In Kansas City, sales and starts were also stronger for entry-level homes than for higher-priced homes. 
Commercial real estate markets remained soft in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted increased office vacancy rates for portions of their Districts while San Francisco reported unchanged 
vacancy rates for commercial and industrial space. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis indicated little or no overall change in commercial markets. Commercial construction opportunities slowed in Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Commercial realtors and contractors in Kansas City and Boston do not see any signs of improvement in the near future. 
Banking and Finance 
Bank loan demand was generally mixed. However, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago reported a moderate rise and New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported an uneven experience. Demand for mortgages and refinancing remained high across the nation, with Richmond noting a marked increase. Contacts in Philadelphia expressed concern about the sustainability of real estate lending in the absence of growth in other sectors. Business lending continued to be weak in all of the reporting Districts. Demand for consumer loans has been strong in Chicago and Atlanta but mixed in New York and Philadelphia. 
Delinquency rates were reported to be either stable or declining. However, credit standards have been tightened for commercial and industrial loans. St. Louis noted that such tightening has 
only occurred for small firms. Credit standards for other loans remained largely unchanged, except in Atlanta, which reported a tightening. Cleveland and Chicago reported no change in the quality of consumer or business loans; Philadelphia, however, noted a mild slippage. 
Atlanta noted a surge in the number of borrowers looking to shorten the term of their loans. Cleveland reported increased competition across all lines of lending while San Francisco noted an increase only for low-risk lending. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Drought conditions across much of the West and portions of the eastern United States have adversely affected both crops and livestock. Although recent rains have improved crop conditions in 
some areas, hot and dry weather during the middle of the year reduced the corn, soybean, and hay crops in parts of the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts. As a result, bankers in the Kansas City District expect crop insurance payments to be a significant source of producers' income this year. Chicago noted that moisture conditions were notably less favorable for crops in Illinois and Indiana than elsewhere in the District, with contacts in central Illinois observing potential corn yields one-third lower than a year ago. In contrast, other portions of the Chicago District expect near-record corn and soybean yields; in addition, San Francisco reported that sales of fruits, vegetables, and nuts were high, spurred in part by strengthened export demand. Prospects for the cotton crop are good in Dallas and St. Louis, and the wheat harvest in Montana is expected to exceed significantly 2001's drought-ravaged crop. 
Livestock producers in the Kansas City, Richmond, and Dallas Districts have been providing supplemental feed to livestock due to dry weather and poor pasture conditions. Richmond also 
indicated instances of hauling water to livestock. Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that livestock farmers were paring herds, with liquidation under way in some areas of the Dallas District. 
Oil producers in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts reported increased oil prices, while natural gas prices, on average, were largely unchanged. Natural gas inventories declined slightly in 
the Dallas District but are expected to be at record high levels when the heating season begins. Reports from Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis indicate that the count of active oil and gas 
drilling rigs remained unchanged in July and August. The Dallas District also noted that foreign drilling activity was down slightly but that revenues were up due to the complexity of the projects.",1,1
2002-08-31,"District reports suggest that the economy expanded modestly in recent weeks, with an uneven performance across sectors. Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Dallas noted some tapering off in economic growth, while Cleveland and St. Louis indicated some improvement. Reports from the rest of the Districts point to continued moderate growth. Overall, prices of finished goods and services remained stable, though there were scattered reports of price pressures. 
Retail sales were mixed, with four Districts indicating some weakening, but five reporting a pickup, partly weather-related. Retail inventories were said to be in good shape, and many retailers expressed optimism about the near-term sales outlook. Vehicle sales were seen as weak in June but were boosted by incentive programs in early July. Manufacturing activity, though mixed across Districts and industries, appears to have improved, on balance. 
Residential real estate and construction activity was widely described as strong, though some softness was reported in the rental segment. In contrast, commercial real estate was almost universally described as weak, though stable in some cases. Travel and tourism activity was reported to be little changed overall, with the Western Districts tending to fare somewhat better than those on the East Coast. Reports from other service industries mostly pointed to stable activity. Banks reported strong demand for residential mortgages, steady demand for consumer loans, and weak, but in some cases improving, demand for commercial loans. Credit quality was still described as good, with no significant increases reported in delinquency rates. Agricultural conditions were described as poor in a number of Districts.

and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
Labor markets were characterized as slack but relatively stable in most Districts; New York and Kansas City indicated some softening, but Richmond noted modest improvement. The pace of wage increases generally remained subdued, but many Districts noted continued escalation of non-wage benefit costs, most notably health insurance. Prices of raw materials were generally stable, though prices of steel, plastics, and lumber have risen noticeably. 
Prices of finished goods and services were generally flat. 
Consumer Spending 
Retail sales were mixed across the Districts, with auto sales getting some boost from incentive programs in July. Some pickup in non-auto sales was reported in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts, with some of the strength attributed to weather. However, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas indicated some weakening in spending. In general, purchases for the home-building materials, hardware, and furnishings-were characterized as strong. None of the Districts reported any complaints about retail inventory levels, although New York and San Francisco mentioned some intended inventory accumulation in anticipation of a longshoremen's strike on the West Coast. 
Looking ahead, there tended to be a general sense of optimism about the near-term outlook, though contacts in a number of Districts expressed concern about the risk that declining equity markets would affect the real economy. Retailers were said to be optimistic about the sales outlook in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City. However, contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts expressed some concern. New York reported a decline in consumer confidence in June. 
Reports from automobile dealers were mixed, with June sales described as somewhat disappointing but July sales boosted by incentive programs. Cleveland noted a decline in 
iii 
new car sales, but steady demand for used vehicles. Looking ahead, auto dealers expressed some concern about inventory levels and future sales prospects in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity was generally reported to have improved modestly. While none of the Districts reported a general decline, many noted that some industries were expanding moderately while others were continuing to struggle. Vehicle assemblies and parts production were reported as expanding by Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Boston, and Atlanta, although Philadelphia reported some slippage in transportation equipment orders. The semiconductor industry has continued to improve according to Dallas, San Francisco, and Boston. 
Production of construction-related materials, primarily residential, was still displaying strength in the Chicago District, generally up according to Dallas, brisk as reported by Philadelphia, and relatively strong in the Atlanta District. New York reported a general increase in overall manufacturing activity through June, but a modest weakening of conditions in early July. Minneapolis reported activity as increasing in Minnesota and the Dakotas. Richmond reported mixed conditions, with a rise in tobacco and paper manufacturing, but slippage in furniture and textiles. Kansas City saw continuing signs of a manufacturing recovery, despite some weakening in the volume of new orders, and firms were not quite as upbeat as a few months ago. Inventories were generally reported as steady or continuing to decline, and nearly all Districts reported continued optimism about the near term. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate continued to show strength in virtually all Districts, but the commercial real estate sector continued to struggle. An overwhelming majority of Districts described the housing market as robust, with sturdy gains in sales activity and varying degrees of price appreciation. The weakest report on this sector came from Dallas where housing markets were said to be unchanged. Despite the overall strength, some weakness was noted at the upper end of the market in Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Declining equity markets were cited as one cause of this relative weakness, though New York noted that there has been no discernible effect thus far. In contrast, a number of Districts indicated that declining stock prices have actually boosted the perceived attractiveness of real estate as an investment. Apartment rental markets were reported to have softened in Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, but to have 
stabilized in New York. Residential construction activity was mixed but generally strong. Strong or 
increasing activity was reported in Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Shortages of developable land were said to be inhibiting construction activity and driving up prices in the Boston and Chicago Districts. 
Commercial real estate markets remained weak in most areas, with increasingly slack conditions noted in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, Cleveland noted an up-tick in conditions, though from low levels. Despite widespread weakness in office markets, Richmond noted some scattered signs of strength in the market for retail and warehouse space. Commercial construction activity continued to be sluggish in most areas. 
Tourism and Services 
Tourism and travel activity was relatively stable, on balance. Signs of improvement were noted across much of the western United States-specifically in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. However, there were reports of modest weakening in Districts along the Atlantic Coast. New York noted some slippage in hotel room rates; Richmond reported strong tourism activity and increased air travel in July but weaker hotel bookings for the months ahead; and Atlanta indicated declining hotel occupancy rates, as 
well as shorter stays and less spending by visitors to Florida. Conditions in other segments of the service sector were mixed. Boston reported that 
insurers have seen strong demand for life insurance but some declines in health plan membership due to softening labor markets. Richmond reports strong growth in trucking and 
shipping activity. Dallas notes slow improvement in service sector activity. 
Banking and Finance 
Banks report little change in overall lending activity, with continued strong demand for home mortgages and continued weak demand for business loans. Some softening in consumer loan demand was reported in New York and Dallas, but a moderate increase was noted in Atlanta. Home mortgage lending was reported to be strong in most Districts, with further strengthening seen in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City. Also, refinancing activity increased in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts but weakened in New York and Cleveland. Delinquency rates were mostly stable and overall credit quality was described as strong and stable in most areas-including St. Louis, which reported an increase in bankruptcy and past-due filings. Tighter lending standards were reported in New York and Kansas City. More broadly, San Francisco reports that the financial sector remains 
healthy, but Philadelphia reports that investment firm revenues have been adversely affected by consumers shifting funds from equities to money markets. Agriculture, Mining, Natural Resources 
Agriculture conditions were mostly reported as poor, although conditions improved in parts of the South and West. Much-needed rains improved conditions in the Dallas District, parts of the Minneapolis District, and in Florida. However, drought or near drought conditions persisted in the Chicago, Richmond, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts, and some states in the St. Louis, Minneapolis and Atlanta Districts. Most soybean and corn- producing areas suffered from oppressive dry conditions. A particularly severe drought continued to pummel Virginia and the Carolinas. Areas with dry weather also reported deteriorated pasture conditions for livestock grazing. 
Energy activity was described as strong by Kansas City and Dallas, though oil and gas drillings leveled off in both Districts in late June and early July after a strong May. Dallas reported smaller energy firms pulling back in recent weeks, cautious about anticipated lower demand for oil and natural gas. Kansas City reported some downward pressure on earnings in the natural gas industry, with prices flat nationwide but falling sharply in Wyoming. Labor Markets, Wages, Prices 
Labor markets were generally reported as subdued, with little or no upward pressure on wages. There were spotty reports of increased hiring in particular occupations, such as engineers, skilled nurses, skilled construction workers, and mortgage processors. While most Districts indicated little change in labor markets, New York and Kansas City reported some softening since the last Beige Book, and most contacts in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts indicated that they had no plans to increase hiring. 
Temporary employment activity was mixed but a bit stronger on balance-while New York and Chicago reported weakness, Richmond, Dallas, Atlanta, and Cleveland indicated some increase in activity. In the manufacturing sector, Richmond and Chicago reported some recent weakening in employment; however, Kansas City noted some improvement, and 
contacts in New York and Richmond indicated some pickup in labor demand in light manufacturing. Richmond and St. Louis commented that manufacturers plan to increase employment in the months ahead. Separately, Richmond reported increased hiring at service and retail firms, but Boston indicated a decline in retail administrative and sales workers. Job declines continued in the airline industry in the Dallas District. 
Wages were reported to be steady. Dallas noted some decline in wages of temp workers, while Kansas City indicated scattered labor shortages, but otherwise there was virtually no mention of wage pressures. However, there were widespread reports of escalating non-wage benefit costs. 
Prices for most goods and services were steady, with the widely noted exceptions of insurance (particularly health insurance), building materials (particularly lumber), steel, plastics and paper. Prices of other inputs, as well as selling prices, remained flat or declined, especially in manufacturing, according to nearly all Districts. There was continued discounting of retail products to entice consumers, according to some Districts. Spikes in wholesale spot electricity prices were reported in the San Francisco District due to warm weather. Boston reported a firming of semiconductor prices but declining prices for other high-tech goods. Dallas noted a continued downward drift of natural gas prices due to a build-up of inventories, which are likely to reach record levels by late summer. Chicago reported a firming of land prices for residential construction, while Richmond reported a moderate rise in service sector and manufactured goods prices.",0,1
2002-07-31,"Reports from Federal Reserve Districts indicated that overall economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in late April and May. The tone was one of modest but uneven growth, with some major sectors showing signs of improvement while others softened or remained weak. Retail sales were flat in most Districts, and auto sales were mixed. Activity in the services and manufacturing sectors improved overall but varied across regions and segments. Residential real estate markets generally remained robust while weakness persisted in most commercial markets. Districts noted few changes in lending markets. Labor markets remained slack in most Districts, but several Districts reported higher demand for temporary workers. Price pressures were in check for most goods and services, but many Districts noted rising steel prices and continued 
increases in energy and insurance costs. Consumer Spending: Most Districts reported that retail sales were similar to year-ago 
levels. Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported that recent sales were flat on a year-over-year basis. According to New York, Chicago, and Dallas, sales were sluggish. Sales 
in the Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts were improved, in contrast. Cleveland reported mixed results. Unseasonable weather reportedly hampered sales in the New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. Most Districts continued to report balanced inventories. 
Reports on automobile sales in late April and May were uneven. Sales were robust in the Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, and Dallas were mixed. Philadelphia and Kansas City said that sales were down on

a year-over-year basis, although Philadelphia noted that sales were at healthy levels. In the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, some dealers complained about lost sales because potential buyers did not qualify for credit. 
Services and Tourism: The services sector posted modest growth. Business was up for financial, legal, information technology, and trucking firms in the Philadelphia District. 
Cleveland reported a significant increase in demand for trucking and shipping services, and the demand for legal services was strong in the New York and Dallas Districts. New York, 
Richmond, and Atlanta said that computer-related service firms were experiencing weak demand; San Francisco noted heavy discounting of software and high-tech services. Boston, in contrast, reported some growth in demand for software products and services, particularly for health care-related software. 
Reports on the tourism and hospitality industry generally continued to indicate an upward trend. Hotel occupancy picked up slightly in the San Francisco District and remained steady in the New York District. Richmond and Boston said that hotels reported steady demand and were hiring additional staff; sources in South Carolina said that business had ""turned the corer"" from September 11 effects. Atlanta and San Francisco reported strong forward bookings for summer 
tourist destinations, and Florida theme parks were adding to payrolls. Chicago noted that a major airline was experiencing strong leisure travel but weak business travel. In the Cleveland District, business conference attendance remained lower than last year. 
Construction and Real Estate: Residential real estate activity remained robust in most Districts. Home sales improved in the New York, Atlanta, and St. Louis Districts compared with 
the previous year, and Richmond said that sales were up overall compared with the last Beige Book. Existing home sales picked up in the Chicago District, but new home sales were not as 
iii 
strong. San Francisco reported solid activity in most areas, while Kansas City noted strong sales of lower-priced homes and weak sales of high-end homes. Philadelphia reported high sales levels and accelerating prices. Richmond also noted rising home prices. Dallas, in contrast, said that builders reported a drop in sales and were offering concessions. Single-family construction varied across Districts, with activity up in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts and remaining solid in most of the Kansas City District. Kansas City and Minneapolis noted slowing or weakness in the multifamily market, but the Manhattan multifamily market strengthened, according to New York. 
Most Districts continued to report weak commercial real estate markets, with high vacancy rates and lower rental rates. Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized commercial markets as weak. Commercial markets eased in the Philadelphia District and declined in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. New York reported that markets were stabilizing in the New York City area. Chicago reported mixed results. Richmond noted an increase in commercial activity, mainly in the office segment. 
Manufacturing: Factory production, shipments, and orders were higher in most Districts, but the gains were uneven across industries. Automakers in the Cleveland District reported strong activity, and Chicago noted a surge in heavy truck orders as customers sought to makepurchasesaheadofEPAregulatorychanges,scheduledtotakeeffectOctober1. Richmond indicated strong growth in shipments and orders for textile products, and St. Louis reported increased demand for a variety of non-durable goods. In the Philadelphia District, 
producers of construction materials continued to report robust demand. Dallas commented that refineries were operating near capacity for most of April and May. According to San Francisco, contacts indicated a pickup in new orders and sales in the semiconductor industry, which allowed 
producers to draw down inventories. More generally, inventories of finished goods were flat or lower in most Districts, although Kansas City noted that some plant managers were increasing inventories. Boston and San Francisco said that orders were down considerably for suppliers of aircraft components. According to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco, demand for telecommunications equipment remained weak. 
Banking and Finance: Demand for bank loans was little changed, with conditions generally better on the consumer side than on the commercial side. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas reported robust consumer lending. Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas said that business lending was soft or sluggish. Chicago said that firms were wary ofborrowing to make large capital outlays. New York, in contrast, reported sagging loan demand on the consumer side but rising demand from commercial borrowers. Improvements in 
bank earnings, loan quality and demand were noted at San Francisco District banks. New York and St. Louis reported tighter or stable credit standards, while Philadelphia and Atlanta noted that some lenders have become more cautious in business lending. According to Cleveland and Atlanta, reports on loan delinquencies ranged from no change to a slight increase. Contacts in New York and Chicago reported that delinquency rates were lower or stable, while St. Louis noted a rise in defaults. Philadelphia reported that the outstanding loan volume has been moving 
up somewhat in recent weeks. Labor Markets and Prices: Labor market conditions improved marginally but 
remained slack overall. As a consequence, reports cited little upward pressure on wages. Labor market conditions were little changed in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Richmond and Dallas said that labor market conditions were mixed, whereas New York reported some improvement. Minneapolis noted that general labor market conditions eased 
slightly. Temporary employment agencies experienced increased demand in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts. Dallas noted that demand for temps rose in the manufacturing sector but declined in several service industries. Temporary worker demand was flat in the Cleveland District. Kansas City and Minneapolis noted an ongoing shortage of nurses, and skilled tradesmen were in short supply in the Kansas City District. 
Price increases remained subdued overall, but the prices of a few goods and services rose substantially. Most Districts reported steel prices were sharply higher. Dallas said that the prospect of further steel price increases had spurred strong sales for fabricated metal products. Rising insurance costs were noted as concerns in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Boston, Richmond, and Dallas reported higher prices for energy and petrochemical products. New York and Dallas reported that manufacturers generally were not able to pass along higher input costs. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources: Many Districts noted poor agricultural conditions. Richmond, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that a drought was hurting crops and cattle in at least part of their Districts; some crops in the Richmond District were stunted by a late frost. Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City also noted problems resulting from unseasonable weather conditions. Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported concerns about low livestock prices, while cattle ranchers in Texas expect to face higher costs because all livestock leaving the state may have to be vaccinated against bovine 
tuberculosis. Energy-related activities were up in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. 
Kansas City attributed some of the rebound to anticipated increases in natural gas prices in coming months. Minneapolis noted expansions in the iron ore mining industry.",0,0
2002-05-31,"SUMMARY* 
Almost all Federal Reserve Districts reported signs of improvement or actual increases in economic activity since the last survey. The sole exception was Boston, which described economic activity as mixed. While the overall tone was positive, a few districts expressed qualifications about the pace of the recovery or the strength of their regional economies. Cleveland said its economy continued to improve but cited concerns that the rate of improvement had slowed considerably from earlier in the year. Also, Kansas City and Dallas noted that their economies were still weak despite recent signs of improvement. 
Retail sales increased or held steady in most districts, and all districts reported stable or improved manufacturing conditions. Manufacturers' capital spending plans, however, remained limited. Residential real estate activity was strong in most districts, as both home sales and construction increased. Tourism activity also improved in most areas, while other services activity held steady. Demand for bank loans was little changed in most districts, although increases were reported in some regions. Commercial real estate markets remained generally weak, especially in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Atlanta districts, but showed signs of steadying in the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City districts. Energy activity continued to ease, and agricultural crops in several districts were damaged by adverse spring 
weather. Despite the increases in economic activity reported in many districts, labor markets 
remained slack and wage and price pressures generally stayed in check. Demand for labor showed signs of firming in several districts but was still reported as weak in others. Except for

skilled health care workers, there were very few reports of labor shortages. Also, those districts that mentioned wage pressures described them as minimal. Retail prices were generally flat. Steel producers sharply boosted prices, but most other manufacturers held prices steady despite reports in some districts of higher costs for fuel, steel, and petroleum-based inputs. 
Consumer Spending 
Most districts reported that retail sales held steady or rose moderately in March and early April. Philadelphia and Richmond reported increased sales from previous months, and Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported sales above year-ago levels. Sales appeared to be weakest in the Dallas district, although retailers there reported some signs of improvement as well. In the New York, Chicago, and St. Louis districts, sales at discount 
retailers were reported to be better than at general merchandise stores. Home furnishing items continued to sell particularly well in most districts. Apparel sales were reported as weak in some districts, but as rebounding somewhat in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland districts. Store managers across the country appeared to be largely satisfied with inventory levels, and were generally positive about the outlook. Retailers in the Kansas City district, however, said they were ready to begin discounting if sales did not meet expectations. 
Automobile sales were characterized as mixed or flat in most districts reporting on such activity. Dealers were cautiously optimistic about future sales in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts. On the other hand, Cleveland district auto dealers did not expect to meet last year's sales levels, and dealers in the Dallas district were concerned that rising interest rates would dampen sales. Dealers in the St. Louis district were also keeping inventories a little lower than usual in case sales did not pick up. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity in March and early April was reported to be either stabilizing or showing signs of improvement in all districts. Plants in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts reported continued growth in orders and shipments, and many plants in the St. Louis district were hiring new and previously laid-off workers. Boston and Kansas City also reported signs of a looming turnaround, but noted that activity was still weak compared with a year ago. Industries reporting the strongest activity included producers of auto parts, steel, residential building materials, and furniture. Activity also remained solid at automobile plants in the Cleveland and Chicago districts and among semiconductor producers in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. Textile and apparel manufacturers in the Richmond, St. Louis, and 
Dallas districts experienced increases in demand as well, but the rebound follows numerous plant closures. Plants in most districts reported a stabilization of inventories following a lengthy period of decline, and some firms in the Chicago and San Francisco districts were cautiously increasing stock levels. 
Manufacturers were generally optimistic about the outlook for factory activity later in the year. Purchasing managers in the New York district, in fact, reported their highest expectations for increases since mid-2000. In contrast, some producers of capital goods in the Boston district expected weakness to continue until 2003. Despite the generally positive outlook, capital spending plans remained rather limited across the country. Kansas City reported a similar number of firms expected to increase as to decrease capital expenditures over the next six months. Philadelphia reported that manufacturers have raised capital spending plans, on balance, 
iv 
but that the planned increases have been spotty and concentrated mainly in the chemicals and plastics industries. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate activity remained robust. Housing markets were reported to be strong in most districts, with both home sales and new construction showing continued gains. The housing market in the Boston district was described as very strong, with listings in short supply throughout the region. In New York, further strengthening in home sales has caused the number of unsold homes to dwindle and has led to some acceleration in housing prices. Richmond also reported especially strong housing activity, with one metro area described as the best sellers' market ever and another metro area said to be experiencing rapidly escalating home prices. There were, however, a few exceptions to the overall strength in housing activity. Home sales softened somewhat in the Chicago district, and residential construction activity remained weak in the Dallas district. Moreover, demand in several districts was weaker for high-end homes than for low- and mid-priced homes, and demand for rental units in the New York district 
was not as strong as that for houses. Commercial real estate activity remained generally weak but appeared to be stabilizing in 
a few districts. Markets remained especially weak in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Atlanta districts. In the San Francisco district, vacancy rates continued to increase, lease rates continued to decline, and new construction was at a minimum. In the Dallas district, office markets were still being held back by overcapacity and weak demand, causing steep declines in rental rates in many areas. Commercial markets in Atlanta also continued to suffer from weak demand, limiting new construction. Commercial builders in the Cleveland district expected to be busy in 
the coming months but were somewhat less optimistic than in the previous survey, with more projects still in the planning stage than they had hoped. On the positive side, commercial markets in a few districts showed some signs of stabilization or improvement. Leasing activity strengthened in the Richmond district, and office vacancy rates appeared to level off in the New York, Chicago, and Kansas City districts following months of steady increases. There were also scattered reports in the Chicago district of sublease space being pulled off the market by tenants who had overestimated the extent of the business slowdown. 
Tourism and Services 
Travel and tourism continued to improve, yet remained below year-ago levels in most reporting areas. Richmond and Minnesota reported strong ski seasons in their districts, and Atlanta reported that theme parks in Florida were busy and cruise lines were operating near 
capacity. New York and Richmond both reported that hotel business had improved. Expectations for the summer travel season were high in most districts. However, Atlanta reported that some contacts fear high fuel costs may limit automobile travel this summer and Kansas City reported that advance bookings at mountain resorts were still trailing year-ago levels. 
Activity in other service industries was generally steady. Trucking service firms in the Cleveland district noted a moderate increase in the volume of manufacturing shipments, while 
Dallas indicated that demand for transportation services was still low relative to past levels. In the Cleveland district, trucking firms' operating margins remained very thin due to high fuel and insurance costs. A media company in the Richmond district reported that ad revenues rose for the first time in over a year, and insurance firms in Boston reported continued high demand for 
life insurance. Demand for legal services, particularly in the areas of litigation and bankruptcy, increased somewhat in the Dallas district. 
Financial Services 
Demand for bank loans held steady or rose modestly in most districts. Banks in the Cleveland, San Francisco and Atlanta districts reported some increase in demand for consumer loans and home-purchase mortgages, while banks in the New York district experienced increased demand for nonresidential mortgages. Demand for business loans was up modestly in the Philadelphia district but flat in other districts. In the Chicago district, banks noted that recent improvements in business sentiment were not translating into increased loan demand. Similarly, banks in the Philadelphia district said their business customers were seeing increased demand but 
were showing little inclination to take out loans to finance the expansion of facilities. In contrast to home-purchase mortgage lending, mortgage refinancing activity in most districts was down from the high levels reached last year. 
Changes in credit quality showed no clear pattern. At banks in the New York district, delinquencies fell for consumer loans and residential mortgages. At banks in the Atlanta district, 
consumer delinquencies increased but remained manageable. Banks in the Chicago district reported that business loan quality had stabilized following previous deterioration but was still 
fragile. Banks in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts were still limiting their commercial real estate lending, and banks in the New York district continued to tighten standards for all types of loans except residential mortgages. Otherwise, lending standards were unchanged in those districts reporting on them. 
Natural Resources and Agriculture 
Activity in the energy sector continued to ease. Despite recent increases in oil and natural gas prices, contacts in the Dallas and Kansas City districts reported that exploration and 
production activity in the oil and gas sector was contracting while Minneapolis reported flat activity. Kansas City indicated that the higher prices have produced some optimism about future 
activity. Some producers in the Dallas district also expressed interest in increased future activity, but others were merely taking advantage of increased prices to improve their balance sheets. Outside of the oil and gas industry, Minneapolis reported that activity in the iron ore sector was expanding with the reopening of some shuttered extraction and processing facilities. 
In the farm economy, spring weather conditions have adversely affected some areas. Continued low levels of soil moisture in most of the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas 
districts have damaged crops, while portions of the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis districts reported excessively wet conditions. Recent cold weather may have also damaged the apple, peach, and strawberry crops in the Richmond district. The winter wheat crop was reported to be doing well in areas with sufficient moisture, including the Cleveland and St. Louis districts, but has been severely damaged in the drought areas ofthe Minneapolis and Kansas City districts. Spring planting is either under way or is expected to begin soon in most districts, with St. Louis and Chicago reporting that more acres are being devoted to corn and fewer to soybeans this year. 
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices 
Labor markets remained generally slack. Modest increases in demand for workers in some industries were reported in the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis districts, but otherwise demand was weak across the nation. San Francisco and Dallas reported",0,0
2002-04-30,"A majority ofFederal Reserve districts report some signs of improvement in economic conditions in January and early February. The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts note some pickup in activity, Chicago cites a more positive tone, and Kansas City and St. Louis say that economic activity is weak, but there are some bright spots. Cleveland indicates that although some positive signs continue to emerge, 
overall business conditions in the district have neither improved nor deteriorated compared with the end of last year. New York reports mixed signals, and Dallas notes continued weak activity. 
Most districts say that manufacturing activity is generally weak, but selected industries in some areas are showing more positive results. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco report modest improvements in retail sales recently compared with the end of last year. Retail results were more mixed in the other districts. Districts indicate that residential real estate markets are generally stronger than commercial markets. Reports on demand for bank loans are mixed across the districts. Warm, dry weather figures prominently in agricultural reports. Warm weather and the slow global economy have contributed to weaker energy demand. 
Labor markets continue to be slack in most districts, with many citing business contacts who have suspended bonuses, frozen wages, or skipped annual salary increases. However, contacts at temporary employment firms in several districts suggest employment is bottoming out, and new hires in selected occupations are said to be in short supply. While wage and price pressures are described as ""subdued"" to ""largely nonexistent,"" business contacts in many districts mentioned rising health insurance costs. Firms in most districts indicate that their purchase and

selling prices are generally stable, but Dallas reports upward pressure on services prices and declining prices for chemicals and paper, while Cleveland notes an increase in spot market prices for steel. Retail 
Most districts report that retail sales during January and February were unchanged from a year earlier, but several noted improvement in early 2002 compared with late 2001. In addition, the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City districts say that sales were higher in early 2002 than a year earlier. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicate that while tourism continues to be weak, it has improved since the second half of 2001. Home furnishings and appliances were reported to be growing strongly in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts. Philadelphia, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco note that motor vehicle sales remain solid, but are down from the rapid pace set in the fourth quarter of 2001 because price promotions have ended; Dallas also reports that automobile dealer profit margins are lower. 
Wage and price pressures in the retail sector are virtually nonexistent. Retail employment is said to be stable in Boston, but down in the Richmond and San Francisco districts. Most districts indicate that retail contacts expect flat to slightly increasing sales during the first halfof2002; only retailers in the St. Louis and Philadelphia districts expect somewhat stronger sales growth during this period. The Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City districts say that retailers expect sales growth to resume at a modest pace during the second half of 2002. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity is reported to be generally weak but showing signs of improvement in at least some industries. The most positive reports come from Philadelphia and 
Richmond, indicating ""moderate"" or ""solid"" growth in manufacturing shipments and orders 
iv 
and accounting firms note strengthening demand for work on litigation, bankruptcy, auditing, and taxes. Demand for communication services improved in the San Francisco district. 
Conditions in the temporary labor market continue to be slack in most reporting districts, but the worst seems to be over. District reports suggest that widespread layoffs have subsided 
and demand for workers appears to be stabilizing. The Richmond district is the most upbeat, with reports of strengthening demand for temporary workers in recent weeks. Atlanta notes improvement in outplacement activity, even though labor market conditions remain weak. Other districts indicate that ample supplies of labor are still readily available, although certain areas of employment in some districts bucked the sluggish trend. The legal industry in New York exhibited strong demand for temps; employers in the Richmond district are seeking light industry workers and customer service representatives; and, in Dallas, demand was strong for administrative and clerical positions, and in the banking and retail industries and some professional services. 
Banking and Finance 
Loan demand is generally mixed in the reporting districts. Dallas, Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco report falling overall demand while Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond report mixed results. Overall lending activity is picking up in St. Louis and Chicago. Demand for consumer loans is down or continues to be soft in the Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia districts, but Atlanta is experiencing growth in demand. Commercial and industrial loan demand is similarly mixed, with Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting increasing demand, Cleveland and Kansas City showing lower demand, and the Chicago, Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts all indicating stable or mixed demand. Mortgage and refinancing loan volumes are steady to strong in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Richmond districts, with only New York and Philadelphia reporting slowing demand. New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco all report stricter loan requirements, while the requirements in Chicago, Dallas, Kansas 
City, and Richmond are reportedly unchanged. Delinquency rates are stable in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and New York. Cleveland and Philadelphia report some decline in loan 
applicant quality. Richmond reports that stock market investors are ""in a holding pattern,"" and Atlanta's contacts note that there is little new money entering the venture capital industry. Real Estate and Construction 
Real estate markets are mixed, with commercial markets almost universally said to be weak while the residential segment remains strong. Increased office vacancy rates are reported in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. The rise in available commercial space has been exacerbated by active sublease markets and additional construction in some areas. Office rents have declined moderately compared with a year earlier. Consequently, commercial construction activity has slowed in most reporting districts. 
Residential markets remained steady or strengthened during the last two months. Home sales and demand for houses are reported to be strong in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, 
Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts. Lower-priced home sales are especially strong, while demand for the high-end segment of the market has weakened in a few districts. New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis note increased home sale prices compared with a year earlier. New home construction was unchanged or increased in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, but was lower than a year ago in Kansas City. Agriculture and Other Natural Resources 
The unusually warm, dry weather in much of the country dominates news from the agricultural sector. The dry spell has resulted in poor conditions for the winter wheat crop or has reduced winter pasturage in the Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts. As a result, Dallas district ranchers are reducing their herds. But in San Francisco, where farmers have already cut their inventories of cattle and field crops, they now report improved prices. Despite 
producer concerns about the farm economy, Kansas City district bankers indicate that farmers' balance sheets remain strong, thanks to steady land values and government support. St. Louis contacts also report a slight rise in land values. Looking ahead, Dallas notes that preparation for the corn and cotton crop is on schedule, and that, despite a cotton surplus and low prices, farmers are planning to plant as normal. In the St. Louis district, farmers expect to plant less wheat and cotton than last year; however, they are waiting for passage of the federal farm bill before finalizing their plans. 
According to the Atlanta and Dallas districts, the second warmest U.S. weather on record for November through January plus global economic weakness have damped demand for heating oil and natural gas and have kept prices low. Minneapolis reports that drilling activity has fallen slightly in recent weeks, while Kansas City notes that the district's count of active oil and gas drilling rigs remains near the two-year low hit in late 2001. In the Dallas district, energy activity shows signs of bottoming out and stocks of crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas are all well above last year's levels. Because firms storing natural gas will not want to hold it over the summer, many Dallas contacts expect significant downward pressure on natural gas prices this spring. In the case of mining, Minneapolis iron ore production is up slightly from late 2001 levels and is nearing more normal levels. In Kansas City, higher coal prices have encouraged increased activity.",0,0
2002-02-28,"Reports from the Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity generally remained weak from late November through early January. But while there are still indications of caution, there are also scattered reports of improvement. The Dallas and San Francisco Districts report a continued decline in activity, while the Cleveland District indicates that the regional economy appears to be in the process of bottoming out. Economic activity remained slow or weak in the Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Kansas City and St. Louis Districts. Activity was mixed according to the Atlanta, Minneapolis and Richmond Districts and showed further signs of rebounding in the New York District. 
Many Districts indicate that their contacts believe a recovery will begin by mid-year or earlier, but the timing and strength are uncertain. Several Districts say that uncertainty has led 
some businesses to budget conservatively for the first quarter. Manufacturing activity was weak or down in most reports, but showed signs of 
stabilizing or rebounding in several Districts. Retail sales picked up in late December and early January but for the period overall posted generally weak results in most Districts. Auto 
sales slowed in December-after very strong sales in October and November-but sales remained relatively strong. Construction and real estate activity continued to soften in most Districts. Commercial real estate markets continued to weaken, and while housing markets held up overall, there was further weakness concentrated in the markets for higher-priced homes. Reports on the service sector were mixed but in general suggest sluggish economic

outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii activity. Financial institutions reported a slight softening of conditions in late November and 
December. Drilling activity continued to contract rapidly in response to lower energy prices, and the airline industry continued to suffer from weak demand and soaring security costs. 
Labor markets remained soft. There are numerous reports of shrinking wage and benefit packages. The Cleveland District notes that employers are invoking ""economic duress"" clauses to renegotiate union contracts. Most Districts report declining prices for goods and services with the notable exception of sharply rising prices for security, health care, and all types of insurance. 
Consumer Spending. Retail sales showed signs of improvement in late December and early January but results were generally weak overall in most Districts. Sales were flat or down compared to last year in the Boston, Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Sales were ""mediocre"" in Atlanta, ""weak"" in Dallas, ""soft"" in Chicago, ""slow"" in St. Louis and ""lackluster"" in San Francisco. Sales were up, however, and better than expected in the Cleveland, Kansas City, New York and Philadelphia Districts. 
According to most Districts, there were aggressive promotions and unusually large discounting that reduced profit margins for retailers. The flurry of sales activity in late December and early January left inventories in good shape. Sales were strongest for home furnishings and electronics according to District reports. Sales of menswear were weak, and warm weather discouraged purchases of winter apparel and seasonal sporting goods. Discount stores continued to report stronger sales than apparel or high-end retailers. The Dallas, Boston and Philadelphia Districts note that retailers have reduced purchases for the first half of 2002 in anticipation of weak sales. 
iii Auto sales were slower in December after very strong sales in October and November. 
Several districts report that sales had remained relatively strong, however, and a few Districts note that December sales were above year-ago levels. The Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City Districts say their contacts expect first-quarter sales to weaken. The Atlanta, Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts note that inventories of used cars are high due to the large number of trade-ins that occurred in October and November. As a result, used car prices have fallen. 
Manufacturing. Manufacturing activity was weak or down in nearly all Districts. Demand is lower for machine tools, metals, textiles, telecommunications and most aircraft equipment. But there are some signs of stabilization or recovery in many reports. For example, the Cleveland District says that the number of manufacturers reporting increases in new orders rose from November to December. In the Atlanta District, several firms noted a modest pickup in new orders and were rehiring some of their recently laid-off staff. 
Auto production was mixed but showed indications of picking up. In the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts, some plants worked overtime hours to meet booming demand for their 
models, while others were forced to close for two weeks because of slumping sales of the models produced at those plants. The Chicago District reports that manufacturers said nationwide light vehicle sales exceeded their expectations again in December despite softening from November. Inventories remained very lean, according to the Chicago District, where one manufacturer indicated that its light vehicle production in the first quarter of 2002 would be 6 percent to 7 percent higher than a year earlier. Demand for some high-tech products has improved since the last survey, according to the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. The Boston and Atlanta Districts report an increase in demand for medical and security-related products, while the Chicago District reports a late-December pickup in steel production. 
iv The reports also suggest more optimism among the country's manufacturers, with 
many predicting a pickup towards the end of the first half of 2002. A higher percentage of plant managers in the Kansas City District expect increases in production than in earlier surveys. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia District indicate that they have slightly raised capital spending plans for the first half of the year in anticipation of an upturn by the middle of the year. Most contacts in the Cleveland District also expect conditions to improve late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. Richmond manufacturers anticipate that 
shipments, new orders and capital expenditures will increase substantially by mid-year. In contrast, most manufacturers of heavy equipment in the Chicago District cut their forecasts for 2002. And, the Boston District reports that capital spending will be tight or reduced significantly according to a majority of their respondents. 
Services. Reports on the service sector were mixed but in general suggest weak economic activity. The Cleveland and Dallas Districts report slow demand for temporary workers. Temporary employment agencies in the Richmond District, however, report somewhat stronger demand for most categories of workers. 
Transportation and tourism activity was reported to be rebounding in December, but demand remains well below year-ago levels according to the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Hotel occupancy rates picked up but are still below a year ago. Business travel remains down, according to the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. But, price cuts stimulated a pickup in leisure travel over the holidays and flights were fuller, according to the Chicago District. The Dallas District notes that the airline industry has significantly reduced capacity over the past two months. With 15 percent fewer aircraft in service compared to a year ago, industry capacity is now at roughly 1997-98 
v levels. Weak demand has pushed revenues down 15 to 20 percent below last year's levels. 
Depressed revenues along with soaring security costs have significantly hurt earnings. Construction and Real Estate. Housing markets continued to hold up in most 
Districts, although there were pockets of weakness, particularly for higher-priced homes. Commercial markets were softer, with the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, New York and Richmond Districts reporting higher office vacancy rates. The Atlanta and New York Districts report an abundance of sublease space, while office rents were lower in the Richmond District. The Chicago and Kansas City Districts say that landlords are offering more generous tenant improvement packages that may be masking the full extent of rent declines in the commercial market. In contrast with other reports, the Cleveland District reported ""uncharacteristically strong"" building activity. 
Banking and Finance. Financial institutions indicated a slight weakening of conditions in late November and December. Soft or declining loan demand is reported in the Chicago, 
Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts. Competition for quality borrowers remained intense, according to the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts. Demand for commercial loans remained weak. Consumer lending has held up in this recession, but it began to soften at the end of December as higher mortgage rates choked off the surge in refinancing activity. Only the Philadelphia District reports rising loan volumes. The Cleveland and San Francisco Districts indicate some deterioration in asset quality, and the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts note some increase in delinquency rates. Tightening credit standards are reported in the Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. The Kansas City, Minneapolis and St Louis 
vi Districts note concern about the absence of a protective snow cover for the winter wheat crop. 
The crop may already have been damaged, according to the Kansas City and St. Louis Districts. Dry weather in the Kansas City District has limited pasture growth, causing most ranchers to be reluctant to expand their cattle herds. Rain and snow helped replenish depleted soil moisture levels and improved the condition of small grain crops in the Richmond District. 
Bankers in the Richmond District said low crop prices continue to leave some farmers financially vulnerable. Livestock producers have benefited from lower feed costs and lower prices for nitrogen fertilizer, however. The St. Louis District notes that the price of natural gas-a major cost component in the production of nitrogen-based fertilizer-fell by approximately 75 percent compared with last year. Government payments to crop producers and strong livestock profits in the first half of 2001 will provide some offset for weakness in farm loan portfolios, according to bankers in the Kansas City District. 
Drilling activity continued to decline rapidly in response to lower energy prices, according to the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. The U.S. rig count fell from over 1000 working rigs in early November to 887 at year-end. Capital spending in 2002 is expected to be down by more than 20 percent according to the Dallas District. 
The San Francisco District reports that interest in siting and building electrical power plants has slowed, with some developers backing off their ""fast track"" approach and taking a more wait-and-see attitude. An iron-ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and a mine in Northern Minnesota both extended a shutdown, according to the Minneapolis District, while another mine in Northern Minnesota ended an eight-week shutdown but is operating at reduced production levels. Several Kansas City District firms report expansion of coal-bed methane exploration activity. 
vii Labor Markets. Labor markets remain soft, according to most District reports. 
Further layoffs are expected in the Boston District, but the Chicago and New York Districts say labor markets are stabilizing. 
While there were reports of shrinking pay increases in the Chicago District, some firms are freezing pay scales in the Boston District, and downward wage pressures are reported in 
the Cleveland, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. These Districts report the elimination of hiring bonuses, decreases in moving allowances and reduced merit increases. Employees are also being asked to pay a larger share of health care and other benefit costs than in past years and to accept more limited health plan options. The Cleveland District says union contracts were being renegotiated due to adverse economic conditions. Employers in the steel and aerospace industries have invoked ""economic duress"" clauses that exempt them from certain job-security provisions. Some of these renegotiations have involved wage concessions or agreements to postpone (with ""give-back"" provisions) scheduled wage increases. 
Prices. Districts report declining prices for most goods and services with the notable exception of security, health care and medical, property and liability insurance. The Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis and New York Districts report steep increases in insurance costs. 
Energy costs are lower and, as the Cleveland District notes, firms have reduced or eliminated energy surcharges. According to the Dallas District, warm weather and flagging demand led to declines in natural gas, crude oil and refined product prices. Forecasts of colder weather and collaboration between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to restrict crude oil production led prices to bounce back to just below mid-November levels. Inventories of most energy products, however, are significantly higher than a year ago.",0,1
2001-11-30,"Reports from all Federal Reserve Districts indicate weak economic activity in September and the first weeks of October. In all Districts, the tragedy of September 11 
was followed by a short period of sharply reduced activity. Business activity recovered quickly from some aspects of the shock, such as reduced air cargo capacity, but longer- run effects are more difficult to assess. Retail sales, other than autos, were slightly lower than before September 11, but this weakness might have already been in train. The same is true for manufacturing. Insurance premiums have increased, and security precautions are disrupting productivity. 
Retail sales softened in September and early October in almost all Districts. Auto sales fell at the beginning of the period but have now rebounded following new zero- financing incentive plans. Both shipments and orders for a broad spectrum of manufactured goods, ranging from steel to semiconductors, are weak in most of the country. Construction generally slowed during the period. The softness in consumer spending, manufacturing, and construction is affecting the labor market, where layoffs and plant closings have been reported in many industries, from financial services on the East Coast to media and advertising on the West Coast to auto parts in the central states. There has been little upward pressure on either wages or prices, and, in some cases, they have actually fallen. The Effect of September 11 
Retail sales followed much the same pattern throughout the country. In the week following the attack, consumer spending dropped sharply for all items except those that were likely purchased in preparation for possible additional attacks. Sales of groceries, security devices, and bottled water increased; purchases of insurance also rose. One to two weeks later, consumer buying picked up somewhat, although in most Districts it was weaker than in early September. Contacts in the Chicago District note that the weakness 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected before October 15, 2001. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
is the result of fundamental economic causes prevailing before the attack, higher unemployment, and falling stock prices, rather than the attack itself. 
The grounding of aircraft caused some very short-run effects. For example, the transport of fresh vegetables from the West Coast to the East Coast was disrupted 
somewhat. The supply chain of parts to manufacturers also was interrupted but appeared to recover quickly from dislocations in air transportation, as air cargo was promptly rerouted through ground networks. 
All Districts except Boston and Kansas City report sharp declines in the hotel, airline, and tourism industries. In many Districts, demand dropped sharply immediately following the attack but later rebounded partially. Some cancelled conventions have been rescheduled. In Manhattan, Broadway theaters have noted some pickup in attendance after a sharp dropoff in mid-September. However, large layoffs in the airline industry may be the result of previously observed weakness in the industry, which was then amplified by the attack. Manhattan lost roughly 7 percent of its office space in the September 11 attack, but an estimated four percent will be repaired in upcoming months. Despite the damage, however, office availability increased slightly on balance in September. 
The attack is likely to have a longer-term effect on manufacturing. Aircraft orders are down sharply, causing layoffs in the aircraft and aircraft parts industries in the Boston, Kansas City, and San Francisco regions. There has been an increase in demand for security products and data storage devices produced in the Cleveland and San Francisco Districts. Boston reports a large rise in insurance demand, while Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco report an increase in insurance premiums. The Atlanta and Chicago Districts report a fall in business productivity due to increased security precautions. Consumer Spending 
Retail sales softened in September and early October in all Districts except St. Louis, where sales were flat, and Minneapolis, where sales were considered normal, and Richmond, where sales returned to pre-attack levels. In the New York District, recent sales were well below levels of a year ago. Almost all regions reported that discount chains were doing much better than specialty stores, and luxury items did poorly. The softer sales tempered the retail sector's forecasts for the holiday season. Most 
Districts report sales expectations that are both more uncertain and lower than they had been in August. 
Automobile sales were much weaker during the first weeks of September, but all Districts, except Boston and New York, report a rebound in sales because of zero-percent financing options that are being offered. In most cases, sales were back to normal, except in the San Francisco and Atlanta Districts, where they were weaker than normal. Atlanta and Chicago also mention that sales of trucks were down. Manufacturing 
Industrial activity was generally weak throughout the country in September and early October. The only exceptions were New York, which reports some pickup in activity, and Richmond, which reports steady activity. Most Districts mention that shipments and orders are weaker than the year before, and, indeed, than in early September. The continued weakness in manufacturing has contributed to pessimism about when orders will improve, as many Districts report that they do not expect a turnaround until 2002. 
The weakness is broadly based. The industries affected by lower shipments and orders include high-tech industries, such as semiconductors in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco regions, as well as the more traditional heavy industries such as steel in the Chicago and Cleveland regions. In spite of robust auto sales, the auto parts industries in the Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, and St. Louis Districts all reported difficult times. The resource-based industries such as lumber reported mill closures in the regions of Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco. A few industries are doing well. Cement in the Dallas region, some textiles in the Richmond region, and luxury goods in Cleveland report some gains. Real Estate and Construction 
Construction generally slowed during September and early October, although there were exceptions in some locations and in some types of construction. Commercial construction weakened in the Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco regions and in the western Kentucky portion of the St. Louis region. Some commercial and industrial projects were put on hold in the Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts. Office builders were less active than in the past in the 
Atlanta, Cleveland, and Richmond regions, as well as in the city of St. Louis. Commercial vacancies rose in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. New York, in spite of the attack, still experienced a slight up-tick in vacancies. Office building held steady in the Cleveland District. 
Residential construction rose only in Philadelphia and some areas of the St. Louis region. It held steady in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts and fell in the Atlanta, 
Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, San Francisco Districts, and some portions of the St. Louis region. In Boston, the decline followed a strong summer, 
so that on a year-over-year basis, construction activity was still up. In the Richmond and New York regions, the decline was seen in the construction of luxury homes. New York also reports a decline in rents in Manhattan. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Most of the year's crops have now been harvested. Corn and soybean harvests were good in the Richmond, St. Louis, and southern part of the Cleveland regions, but were below normal in the Chicago, Kansas City, and northern part of the Cleveland regions. Prices for cattle and hogs are low. Kansas City reports that the winter wheat crop is in the ground ahead of schedule. Atlanta reports a poor cotton harvest. Minneapolis and Dallas report weather-related poor crop yields, but San Francisco notes that West Coast harvests have generally been good. 
Decreases in oil and natural gas prices have led to a decline of drilling activity in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts. Decreases in steel production have caused several iron ore mines to close in the Minneapolis District. Financial Services and Credit 
Banks experienced greater mortgage refinancing activity in response to lower interest rates across Districts. New mortgage lending was also reported to have increased in all but four districts: Kansas City and San Francisco, where loan activity generally decreased in most categories, and Boston and Dallas. Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis report consumer loans were down. Cleveland, Philadelphia, and St. Louis report increases in commercial lending, and Chicago, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis report decreases in these loans. 
The Chicago, Cleveland, New York, and San Francisco Districts report that loan delinquencies were up, and credit standards were reportedly higher in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and New York Districts. Nonperforming loans were higher in the Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts. Employment 
Many Districts report layoffs in a wide variety ofjobs. Large manufacturing layoffs are reported in the Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis regions. In the service sector, hotel, tourism, and airline industries laid off people throughout the country. In addition, the Dallas, Richmond, and Philadelphia Districts saw cutbacks in the retail sector, and New York reports layoffs in the financial services industry. The West Coast's media and advertising industry also experienced large layoffs. Wages and Prices 
Most Districts report little or no change in wages. Manufacturers were reducing salaries in the Boston District, and wages were down in parts of the San Francisco 
District. Steady wages or no wage pressure are reported in the Chicago, Kansas City, New York, and Richmond regions, as well as among temporary workers in the Minneapolis region. The Atlanta, Cleveland, and Dallas Districts report that wage pressures had subsided or were subdued. Dallas and San Francisco also report an increase in health care costs. 
Most Districts report steady or declining consumer prices. Districts reporting steady retail prices included Kansas City and Richmond. San Francisco reports steady 
prices except for declining prices in apparel. Districts reporting lower retail prices included Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. The prices for manufactured goods also fell in the Chicago, Dallas, and New York regions, while they were steady in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Richmond, and San Francisco regions. 
Input prices are reported as decreasing or holding steady, except in Cleveland, where they were mixed. Districts reporting price declines included Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, and New York. Those reporting steady prices were Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco.",1,1
2001-10-31,"Summary. Reports from Federal Reserve Districts generally indicated that overall 
economic activity remained sluggish in August and early September, with several suggesting that activity slowed further. Back-to-school buying gave retailers in some regions a boost in sales, but overall consumer spending generally was said to be flat to down. Residential real estate markets were described as ""brisk,"" ""strong,"" or ""steady"" in most reports, buoyed in large part by low mortgage rates. By contrast, demand for commercial space reportedly softened further in most Districts. Manufacturing activity remained weak in nearly all regions, and the softness appeared to be broad based. Lending activity was mixed. Demand remained strong for residential mortgages, while demand for business loans was flat to down in most Districts as many lenders continued to tighten standards on some commercial loans. Relatively soft labor markets persisted in most Districts, with a few reports indicating further easing. Upward 
pressure on wages remained subdued, but contacts in some Districts continued to express concern about rising health insurance premiums. Upward price pressures were again restrained in nearly all Districts. Input cost pressures were said to be easing as well. 
Consumer spending/tourism. Overall consumer spending remained soft in most of the country during August and early September, while upward pressures on retail prices were subdued. Over half of the District reports indicated that retail sales were flat to down in the reporting period. Atlanta and Minneapolis reported retail sales increases, as did Dallas but from very weak levels. In the important back-to-school segment, merchants in the Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts noted strong sales, while those in the New York, Philadelphia, and

This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Kansas City regions had mixed, less-than-expected, and flat results, respectively. Federal income tax rebates had only a limited effect on spending in August, with New York and Chicago indicating no significant impact, while the Atlanta report suggested that tax rebates (along with heavy discounting) boosted overall sales. Minneapolis noted that state sales tax rebates helped retail sales. Consumers in many areas remained value-conscious, and large discount stores continued to outperform general merchandisers in some regions. Merchants in over half the Districts expected either flat sales or only moderate growth for the remainder of the year, with one contact in the Boston region describing the retail outlook as ""grim."" Most Districts reported that retail inventories were in good shape. Total sales of new light vehicles were relatively soft in most regions, and the Cleveland and Dallas reports noted a shift toward used vehicles. Reports of tourism spending were mixed, while business travel generally remained soft. Upward pressure on retail prices appeared to ease further in some regions, and Chicago and Dallas indicated that there were more reports of price decreases than increases. 
Construction/real estate. Real estate and construction activity were mixed, as the residential side remained strong, while the commercial segment softened further. Residential 
sales were relatively steady at high levels in most of the country, even in the Districts that reported slightly softer sales activity-New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. Softness was noted, however, in the demand for high-end homes in some reports, while Kansas City and Dallas indicated that overall home sales were soft in a few high-tech intensive areas. Contacts in many regions attributed much of the strength to continued low mortgage rates. District reports indicated that commercial activity remained weak in nearly all regions, and softened further in most. Downward pressure mounted on office rental rates as available space continued to increase. The amount of sublease space becoming available picked up in the St. Louis and 
iii 
Minneapolis Districts, while it reportedly slowed in the Chicago and Dallas regions. Industrial real estate markets softened in one-third of the Districts, while retail development declined from high levels in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. Hotel occupancy fell in a few regions, leading to decreased room rental rates. 
Manufacturing. Overall manufacturing activity was weak again in August, but there were positive signs contained in a few District reports. Virtually all regions reported that new orders and production were weak, and nearly one-half suggested that conditions had deteriorated further. However, Boston, New York, Chicago, and Kansas City reported that the declines in manufacturing activity appeared to be stabilizing, while Richmond's manufacturing sector expanded for the first time in a year. Capital equipment spending remained weak, as contacts in some Districts reported that businesses had a ""wait and see"" attitude. Nearly one-half of the Districts indicated that high-tech manufacturing industries generally softened further in August. Some contacts in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, however, suggested that the sector may have bottomed. Most Districts reported that manufacturers continued to trim inventories and many suggested that further inventory reductions were in the offing. Soft demand and stiff competition, in many cases from foreign producers, kept downward pressure on selling prices, and most input prices were reportedly flat to down. Increases in new orders and production in machine tool and shipping/packaging materials were noted by Chicago and Minneapolis. 
Banking/finance. Overall lending activity was reported to be mixed, as household demand for loans remained strong in most areas while softness in business lending persisted. Over half of the District reports indicated that household lending activity remained relatively robust, with only Boston, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco reporting a general softening. Low mortgage interest rates continued to buoy home buying and spur mortgage refinancing in 
many areas. Contacts in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts suggested that consumer delinquencies increased in the latest period, and New York noted rising delinquencies on residential mortgages. Reports on business lending activity were mixed, but generally indicated soft demand. Only the Philadelphia and Kansas City reports alluded to a general pickup in business lending activity, but the increases were very modest. One-third of the Districts noted a further deterioration in business loan quality, although contacts indicated that banks were well positioned to weather the increases in nonperforming or problem loans. Banks in one-third of the regions continued to tighten standards on business loans. Deposit increases were noted by Boston, Kansas City, and Dallas, while St. Louis reported a slight decline. 
Labor markets. Labor markets continued to ease in most parts of the country in August with over half the District reports suggesting soft and/or softening demand for labor. Boston and St. Louis indicated that demand for high-tech workers continued to erode, while Atlanta suggested that potential employers had become much more selective and high-tech job searches had become longer. Staffing agency reports were mixed, but generally pointed to continued weaker demand. By contrast, New York reported that overall labor demand was stable, while St. Louis indicated that worker shortages persisted despite recent loosening of labor markets. Richmond, Kansas City, and Minneapolis noted a shortage of nurses. There were also signs of stabilization in manufacturing employment in a few regions. Boston noted an increase in weekly hours, and Chicago reported that a few manufacturers were calling back a small percentage of furloughed workers. There were scattered reports of moderately increasing wages but, for the most part, upward wage pressures continued to ease along with labor demand. In fact, the Cleveland report suggested that unions were trading off negotiated wage increases in exchange for job security provisions. Contacts in four Districts expressed concern over rising health 
insurance costs, while those in the Atlanta and Chicago regions also noted rising liability insurance costs. 
Agriculture/natural resources. Agricultural conditions were reportedly mixed across the country. Districts that span the Plains or northern portions of the Corn Belt (Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas) reported inadequate moisture conditions in many areas that were expected to negatively affect corn, cotton, and soybean yields. Recent rains were expected to help the winter wheat crop in some areas and provide a boost to late soybean yields, but were too late to help corn yields. Districts covering the southern Corn Belt and the southeastern states (Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis) reported generally favorable conditions for the corn, cotton, soybean, and peanut crops. San Francisco recorded mostly favorable crop conditions but noted that continued low market prices were stressing some producers. Chicago and Minneapolis also indicated that some bankers expressed concern about low levels of farm-derived income and the financial health of their customers. 
Extractive natural resource industries were reported to be operating at high levels in most cases. The active oil and gas rig count in August was reported level to slightly lower than July in the Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. Kansas City noted that drilling activity remained constrained by a shortage of rig workers. Minneapolis observed that mining activity varied across the District. Most iron mines were back in full production, following a slowdown earlier in the summer, while several nonferrous metal facilities in Montana remained closed.",0,1
2001-08-31,"Reports from most Federal Reserve Districts point to slow growth or lateral movement in economic activity in June and July. Retail sales generally were sluggish and frequently below expectations, despite substantial discounting on a wide range of consumer goods. Manufacturing activity in nearly all sectors and regions declined further in recent months as producers adjusted to weak domestic and foreign demand and worked through accumulated inventories. Sustained weakness in the manufacturing sector spilled over to other businesses, with many Districts indicating declines in demand for office space and trucking and shipping services. In contrast, residential real estate markets remained stable and even expanded in some areas, with the relative strength of the sector attributed in part to lower mortgage interest rates. Agricultural producers continued to struggle against low prices, weak exports, higher energy costs, and the weather, although some regions reported improvement in growing conditions since the last survey period. Financial institutions across the country reported reduced demand for a wide variety of loans, tighter credit standards, and stable-to-deteriorating quality of existing loans and leases; residential mortgages were the notable exception to these trends. 
Continued slow economic growth loosened labor markets and eased wage pressures in most Districts in June and July, but rising benefit costs continued to add to compensation costs. Prices for energy, fuel, and many material inputs fell in most regions. Falling input costs and stiff domestic and foreign competition kept prices of most consumer goods in check.

Consumer Spending 
Retail sales generally remained weak in June and July, although there were scattered reports of a pickup in sales. Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco reported sales below expectations and well beneath comparable store sales for the same period last year. Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, and St. Louis noted a slight pickup in sales since the last survey period, though sales were flat to down compared to last year. Kansas City and Philadelphia reported flat sales during the last survey period. The weakness in retail sales was broad-based across product lines and types ofoutlets. Within the sector, sales were strongest at large discount retailers, though many other retailers were offering discounts to promote sales. Auto sales apparently fared better than other areas of consumer spending in some Districts. Districts attributed the better-than-expected sales in part to manufacturer incentives and lower financing charges. 
Districts reporting on inventories at retail outlets indicated that most businesses were able to keep stocks in balance. Still, there were scattered reports of retailers canceling orders or asking manufacturers to warehouse deliveries until existing inventories are cleared. Contacts noted that orders for back-to-school and Christmas merchandise were running lower than last year in anticipation of slower sales. Services and Tourism 
Districts reporting on the services sector indicated continued weak demand in June and July. In Dallas, Cleveland, and San Francisco, demand for business services, including advertising, computing and data processing services, and temporary employment agencies, was stagnant or declining in recent months, resulting in employment reductions in some areas. In Cleveland and Dallas, transportation and shipping activity declined further in June and July, as 
iii 
businesses continued to reduce orders in an effort to control inventories. Accounting, insurance, and legal firms also saw demand soften in some Districts, prompting more rigorous monitoring of payroll costs and other expenses. Dallas noted a pickup in demand for legal services related in part to energy market developments and increased bankruptcy filings. 
Layoffs and slower economic growth reportedly damped tourism in many parts of the country. Many Districts noted that airline bookings, hotel occupancies, and hotel room rates fell in recent months. However, hotels principally struggled with a decline in business travel as companies worked to cut costs in light of slower earnings growth. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity declined further in recent weeks, as producers responded to ongoing weakness in demand and worked to balance inventories. Reports of reduced work 
hours, lost overtime, forced furloughs, planned shutdowns, and layoffs were pervasive. Nearly every District reported that new orders and shipments for durable and non-durable manufactured products remained sluggish during the recent survey period, with declines recorded for producers in some sectors. Weakness was especially evident among producers of apparel and textiles, computers, semiconductors, steel, and telecommunications gear. In addition to conditions in the domestic economy, Districts attributed the current malaise in manufacturing to softening international demand for U.S. goods- particularly in Europe and Asia. On the up side, Districts reported that producers were making progress in running down their excess inventories. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Conditions in commercial real estate markets softened in several Districts in June and July, in keeping with slow economic growth. Nine Districts reported increased office vacancies in metropolitan areas in the second quarter, with signs of additional weakening in July. A 
number of Districts noted that the swing in market conditions was due in part to an increase in sublease space. The rise in vacancies reportedly made it a buyers market in some metropolitan areas. However, most Districts noted little movement in posted lease rates, with landlords opting for one-time inducements such as a free month's rent or property upgrades to attract tenants. In San Francisco, where commercial lease rates have declined, contacts noted that prospective tenants appear to be waiting for rates to fall further. Rising vacancies damped new construction activity in a number of areas. 
Districts indicated that residential real estate markets generally remained stable in recent months, though signs of weakness were apparent in some regions. Atlanta, Cleveland, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis reported continued brisk demand for low and moderately priced homes; one District reported that homes ""priced right"" continued to sell quickly, often attracting multiple bidders. In Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco, demand remained stable but weakness in the high-end market was noted. Dallas and Kansas City reported flat to slower growth in home sales, with some concerns about rising inventories. In general, Districts attributed the continued strength of residential real estate in part to lower mortgage interest rates. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed across the Districts. Atlanta, Kansas City and St. Louis highlighted generally good conditions in their regions, with some crop yields coming in better than expected. Dry weather was having an adverse effect on farmers and ranchers in the Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and Richmond Districts. San Francisco reported favorable growing conditions, but ongoing struggles against low prices, weak export demand, and high energy costs. 
Banking andFinance 
Loan demand was flat to down in most Districts in recent weeks. However, the composition of the slowdown differed by region. In Kansas City and Philadelphia, commercial and industrial lending picked up, while consumer lending declined. Declines in lending in Atlanta, Chicago, and Richmond were largely in the commercial sector. In St. Louis, all types of loans declined, although the most pronounced reductions were in consumer borrowing. In Cleveland and New York, loan demand remained relatively flat, as both consumers and businesses curtailed borrowing. Several Districts reported increases in home mortgage lending. 
Overall, Districts characterized financial markets as cautious, with both borrowers and lenders pulling back in response to economic uncertainty. There were some reports of deteriorating credit quality, particularly for credits to manufacturing and agricultural businesses. A number of Districts reported that lenders had tightened standards in recent weeks, particularly for business loans. Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices 
Most Districts reported that conditions in labor markets remained steady or loosened somewhat in recent weeks. Layoffs in many high-tech manufacturing and service firms boosted the number of highly skilled workers applying for jobs through temporary employment agencies. Employers in a number of Districts noted greater ease in finding and keeping qualified workers. 
Looser labor markets in most Districts helped to contain wage pressures in recent months. However, benefit costs rose, particularly for health and other forms of insurance coverage. Rising insurance premiums and the slowing economy reportedly prompted some employers to reevaluate benefit packages. Kansas City reported that firms were working on ways to reduce employee benefits such as free parking and health club memberships. 
Fuel and energy prices fell in June and July in most Districts, lessening the burden on businesses and easing pressure on consumer budgets. Lower gasoline prices allowed shippers and truckers to reduce or remove fuel surcharges imposed earlier this year. Lower energy costs also contributed to price declines for a number of manufactured goods. However, upward price pressure was reported for pharmaceuticals, various services, and single-family housing in some regions. In addition, retail electricity rates were up sharply in California in June, as previously authorized rate hikes took effect. In general, however, declining input costs and stiff domestic and foreign competition continued to restrain consumer prices",0,0
2001-07-31,"Most districts report that economic activity was little changed or decelerating in April and May. Retail sales and tourism have been slow to flat across the nation. Most districts report that manufacturing activity has declined or remained weak. Commercial real estate markets have softened. New construction, while still at high levels in a number of districts, appears to have leveled off. The agricultural sector has been hurt by adverse growing conditions and higher input costs. Mining activity is stagnant. The one bright spot is the continued growth in energy exploration. Labor markets continue to ease in all districts, although a shortage of workers is reported for some occupations. Wage and price increases are moderate, but significant increases are noted in energy and health care. Lending activity varies based on location and type of loan, although credit quality has slipped in many districts. 
Consumer Spending 
Districts report that growth in consumer spending has been lackluster. Boston reports spending at or below last year's levels. Spending in New York, Philadelphia, 
Minneapolis and Kansas City in May was little changed from a year ago. Richmond sees purchases slowing from earlier in the year, and Chicago reports a disappointing May after a stronger-than-expected April. Cleveland and Atlanta report modest growth, and Dallas

ii 
says consumer spending is flat or up slightly. Weather was noted by a number of districts as a contributing factor to recent slow retail sales. 
Auto sales in Philadelphia are lower than last year. Auto sales fell in Kansas City, particularly for trucks and SUVs, but dealers are cautiously optimistic about summer prospects. Minneapolis reports auto sales on par with a year ago in North Dakota, but new car and truck registrations are down from last year in South Dakota. Sales for more fuel-efficient vehicles are ""picking up"" in Chicago. In Dallas, auto sales are increasing slowly, but year-to-date figures are still below those of 2000. Houston auto dealers report very strong auto sales in April. 
Tourism is lackluster. New York reports that Manhattan's hotel occupancy rates in March and April were 10 percentage points lower than a year ago, and average room 
rates saw the biggest decline in eight years. Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas report slow commercial air travel. High fuel prices and consumer uncertainty appear to be restraining travel to Hawaii, Las Vegas and other high-end destinations in the San Francisco district. 
In contrast, Richmond reports strong Memorial Day bookings and spending. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity decreased or slowed in May for all the districts. Several districts report weak new orders and higher inventory levels. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco report weakness in the telecommunications industry. Richmond notes declines in furniture sales. Cleveland reports high steel inventories, while San Francisco states rising inventories of semiconductors. Kansas City indicates that factory stocks are still above desired levels. 
However, Chicago reports that many contacts say the worst of high inventory levels is over. St. Louis reports planned expansions of output in the high-tech, tobacco and chemical industries. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Commercial real estate and construction have slackened somewhat in several districts. ""Softening,"" ""stagnant,"" ""weak,"" ""flat"" and ""continued to cool,"" describes overall activity in most districts. Exceptions include the St. Louis district, where commercial construction is steady, and the San Francisco district, where commercial real estate markets are sound, but with signs of weakening. Nine districts report higher vacancy rates, with increased subleasing activity as company downsizing has led to more available space. Rental rates for leased space are steady to lower in parts of the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta and Dallas districts. 
Residential construction is mixed, while home buying is generally active. Homebuilding is strong in the St. Louis district and expanding modestly in Kansas City; however, homebuilding is soft in the Chicago and Minneapolis districts. Residential real 
estate markets are fairly buoyant in the New York district, while recent sales increases are reported in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Minneapolis. In the Kansas City district home sales are flat, while sales have slowed in the Philadelphia, Chicago and Dallas districts. The inventory of homes on the market is low in Philadelphia, but is higher in at least parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts. 
Agriculture 
Spring plantings are nearly complete across the nation, but difficulties persist. Weather problems are reported in Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco. In addition, pest damage is reported in the St. Louis and Dallas districts. Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco note higher production costs. 
Natural Resource Industries 
Energy exploration activity is robust due to high prices for natural gas and oil, while mineral mining activity is sluggish. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco report increases in the number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs. The count of active drilling rigs in the Kansas City district reached an eleven-year high. Meanwhile, the Minneapolis district reports weak iron ore, copper and aluminum activity. Iron ore shipments are down and a copper mine and an aluminum smelter remain closed. 
Labor Markets 
Districts report overall easing in labor market conditions, with tightness noted in some occupations. More people are looking for work, and hiring is considered easier. 
Information technology workers are having more difficulty finding jobs in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas districts. Demand for temporary staffing 
services is soft in the Boston, Cleveland and Richmond districts. Some retailers in New York report a decrease in employee turnover. However, examples of worker shortages 
include nurses in Atlanta, warehouse and light industrial workers in Richmond, 
construction workers in Kansas City, and engineers, welders and office workers in some areas of the Dallas district. 
Wages and Prices 
Most districts saw only modest pressure on wages. The Boston market for all levels of tech workers ""has softened dramatically"" and dampened wage pressure. Atlanta says new technology workers are being offered smaller compensation packages than last 
year. Minneapolis sees limited growth in manufacturing wages. In Kansas City, wage pressures ""were virtually nonexistent outside of the energy sector,"" and workers report favoring job security over higher wages. San Francisco says the easier labor market has reduced wage pressure. However, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco say costs are rising for health care and other employee benefit items, with districts reporting examples of annual increases running as high as 20 percent. 
Non-energy prices are generally reported stable. Dallas says that stiff competition, excess capacity and high inventories are keeping prices in check in telecommunications and other industries. High inventories are reportedly keeping prices down in the retail sector and in some cases pushing them lower. Retailers - particularly of high-end goods - in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Francisco report deeply discounted prices to move overstocked inventories and boost sales. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco report that manufacturer rebates and other incentives have helped lower car and truck prices. Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Dallas all report higher lumber prices. 
Districts report higher energy prices across the board, with mixed consequences. Shipping costs are up in Cleveland; Dallas reports that rail transport surcharges are increasing; San Francisco says that surcharges are increasing but ""price pass-throughs remained partial."" 
Banking and Finance 
Lending activity and credit quality vary by sector and area. Deterioration in credit quality is noted in New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco, 
though not in Philadelphia. Commercial loan demand is up in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, but down in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco. Consumer loan demand is subdued in Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas, but mixed in Philadelphia, and up in New York, Cleveland and Kansas City.",0,0
2001-05-31,"Almost all districts report a slow pace of economic activity in March and early April. Retail sales were weak in March, but strengthened in April. Still, retailers in most districts are 
expecting only small gains, at best, in upcoming months. Vehicle sales have been mixed, with demand for new SUVs, trucks and luxury cars generally down. Industrial activity has continued to weaken, with orders and production having fallen in many districts. Labor market tightness has eased in almost every district. Upward wage pressures have generally abated, only to be replaced with energy costs that have risen sharply. Home sales and new construction have remained steady or been picking up in almost all districts. Commercial construction has been more uneven across districts. Lower mortgage rates have spurred a resurgence of refinancing, which has helped bolster loan growth recently. Many districts note, however, that credit standards are tighter now than previously. The winter wheat crop is generally in good condition, while some delays in spring plantings and the development of other crops have been noted in the Midwest and Plains. The energy sector continues to strengthen. 
Consumer Spending 
Almost all districts report that retail sales in March were flat-to-down from a year earlier, but showed improvement in early April. The Boston, Kansas City and San Francisco districts note that sales have been below expectations, while the Atlanta, Chicago and St. Louis districts report that sales have either met or exceeded expectations. In the Boston, Kansas City, Philadelphia and St. Louis districts, big-ticket items-such as jewelry, appliances and electronics-have been slow movers; in the Chicago district, however, household appliances and electronics have reportedly been strong sellers. The Chicago and New York districts note that sales of seasonal merchandise and apparel have been weak, while the same merchandise

Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
has been moving quite well in the Cleveland and Philadelphia districts. The Minneapolis district notes an uptick in demand for used computers lately. Most districts report that retailers' inventories are currently at desired levels; in parts of the Kansas City district and in Idaho, however, some retailers' inventories are a bit high. Retailers in the Cleveland district have been successful at reducing their excess inventories through large markdowns. Almost all districts report that retailers are expecting only mild sales growth, if any, in the upcoming months, with contacts in the Dallas district, for example, noting that they have lowered their sales expectations for rest of the year. 
Vehicle sales are mixed around the country. The Cleveland, Kansas City, New York and Philadelphia districts report that sales are up, while the Chicago, Dallas, Richmond and St. Louis districts report that they are down. Almost across the board, however, districts note that higher gas prices appear to have reduced demand for new SUVs, luxury vehicles and trucks. On the other hand, sales of lower-priced and used vehicles have been relatively strong, especially in the Dallas and St. Louis districts and in the Buffalo region. Dealers in the Richmond district have been trimming their inventories as sales have softened; some dealers in the Dallas and St. Louis districts also report high inventories, especially of SUVs and trucks. In other districts, current vehicle inventories are at desired levels. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity 
Manufacturing activity continues to weaken across districts, with demand having fallen in most industries. Orders and production are down in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond and San Francisco districts. Some districts report that excess inventories, which had been growing since the beginning of the year, are starting to fall because of production cuts. In the Boston and San Francisco districts, though, manufacturers still express concerns about excess inventories. The Philadelphia district's manufacturing 
iii 
sector is a mixed bag, with orders down in April, but shipments steady. Furniture sales have continued to decline in the Richmond and St. Louis districts because of slack demand. 
The high-tech and telecommunications industries are experiencing a pronounced slowdown. Activity has eased in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, San Francisco and St. Louis districts, where new orders or sales of computer-related equipment have dropped. Sales of such equipment in the Boston district, however, are up moderately. The Atlanta and Dallas districts still have excess inventories of telecommunications equipment. 
There were some scattered areas of improvement, however. In New York, for example, conditions varied across the state: the New York City and Buffalo areas have been bright spots, with manufacturers experiencing an increase in production; the Rochester area reports further weakening in business conditions. Tourism and hospitality demand have remained moderately strong in the Atlanta and Richmond districts, where the Easter holiday and spring breaks during March and April were a boon for these industries. Business travel, however, is reportedly down, with travel-industry contacts in the Philadelphia district reporting some slowing recently. 
Manufacturing contacts in the Cleveland and Philadelphia districts are optimistic, expecting orders and demand to pick up by this summer. Boston, Chicago and St. Louis district contacts are uncertain to pessimistic, with expectations of slower sales in the coming months. Businesses in most districts expect a slowing in capital spending this year; in the Philadelphia district, however, the number of firms planning reductions is offset by an equal number planning increases in capital spending budgets. Labor Markets 
While some districts still mention that labor markets are tight, almost all note that this tightness has been easing, especially in the manufacturing sector. Most contacts in the Atlanta, 
Boston, Chicago, Kansas City and St. Louis districts have commented that filling vacancies has become easier. The Dallas district, however, reports that quality workers are still elusive, and 
construction workers are still in short supply in the Chicago and Kansas City districts. Skilled workers in the energy sector are also in short supply in the Kansas City district. The New York district notes a continuing backlog of demand for workers in the financial services industry, though this has become less pronounced in recent weeks. Employment in the St. Louis district's retail trade and service sectors are picking up because of strengthening demand. 
Wages and Prices 
Nearly all districts report that energy costs are up sharply, hitting historic highs in some areas. Boston district contacts, however, note that energy concerns have waned somewhat since the last report. The trucking industry has been hit the hardest by high gasoline prices. Several districts, especially Dallas and San Francisco, report that firms are increasingly passing on these high costs to customers as fuel surcharges. Hikes in electricity costs are concerns in both the Philadelphia and, especially, San Francisco districts. 
Upward wage pressures have generally abated. Wages are rising very moderately or are unchanged in most parts of the country except the Richmond and San Francisco districts, where scattered wage increases are noted. Retail prices are steady in most districts except Richmond, where retail prices have been rising at a quicker pace in recent weeks. By and large, non-energy input costs are stable, with only a few exceptions. Manufacturing materials prices in the Chicago and Kansas City districts, for example, continue to rise, while construction materials prices in the Minneapolis district have decreased somewhat. The Dallas district is experiencing downward price pressures for metals and high-tech products. The Atlanta and Chicago districts note increases in health insurance costs. Real Estate and Construction 
The consensus across most districts is that residential sales and construction have been picking up or steady, although segments of the market in some districts are experiencing a slowdown. Agents in the Boston, Cleveland and Richmond districts report that stronger sales of 
low- to mid-priced single-family homes account for most of the increase in residential activity. The Boston and New York districts note active residential real estate markets, although the New York district reports some market easing since the last report, while Boston district markets still face housing shortages. Home sales in the Chicago district have been better than expected, with price appreciation remaining strong and housing shortages persisting. St. Louis district agents are seeing excess inventories of housing begin to shrink. In the San Francisco district, home sales are strong in Hawaii, while they are slowing in Washington. The Atlanta district is experiencing a flat-to-down trend in sales of new, single-family homes, even though strength is apparent in most Florida markets, where home sales and construction are up from a year ago and prices continue to increase. Home construction is strong in the New York district, despite a drop in demand in New Jersey. 
Commercial construction across districts is a bit more uneven. The Philadelphia district reports that, despite strong activity, contract awards have recently declined. The San Francisco 
district notes that overall activity remains sound, even though vacancy rates are up and rental rates are down in some regions of the district. The Kansas City district indicates that activity is 
flat and that sales and leasing have fallen. The Dallas district is experiencing a slowing in commercial construction, with demand for all types of nonresidential space down. Construction 
in areas of the Cleveland district are stagnant, with many firms reportedly putting expansion plans on hold indefinitely. In the St. Louis district, however, contractors indicate that there has 
been a consistent flow of new projects, a trend they are optimistic will continue. 
Banking and Finance 
Lower mortgage rates have led to a resurgence of refinancing in many districts. In the Richmond district, for example, a banker has indicated that refinancing now accounts for almost 90 percent of his bank's lending activity. Mortgage refinancing is also up in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City and New York districts. The Philadelphia district notes that home equity 
loans are on the rise, as consumers consolidate other debts into these loans. At the same time, many districts have observed declines in business loan activity. The Dallas district notes that businesses are now frequently using such loans to pay for operating costs instead of expansions. The New York and Philadelphia districts, though, are seeing some upticks in business lending. The Kansas City and St. Louis districts report declines in consumer loans, an ongoing trend in the St. Louis district. The Atlanta, Cleveland and New York districts, on the other hand, have seen increases in consumer loans. The San Francisco district reports that loan growth, in general, has moderated. 
Half of the districts-Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, New York and San Francisco-are reporting tighter credit standards, particularly for business loans; the Cleveland 
district, however, reports that credit standards have remained essentially unchanged. The Richmond district notes that lenders have become more cautious when making loans to marginally profitable businesses. The Kansas City district reports deposit growth in line with loan growth; the St. Louis district reports stronger deposit growth than loan growth. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural reports are mixed. The winter wheat crop is developing well in the Cleveland district, is varied widely across the Kansas City district, and, because of abundant moisture levels, is in good-to-excellent condition in the St. Louis district. The Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis districts note some delays in plantings and development of other crops. In contrast, the Richmond district reports good planting conditions for corn, but notes that an early April cold snap caused some damage to apple and peach crops and forced vegetable growers to replant several crops. Limited water and high energy prices are encouraging farmers in the Dallas district to plant cotton instead of corn. Producers in parts of the St. Louis district intend to substitute cotton for corn and soybeans on some acreage. Most crop prices remain depressed and continue to adversely affect farmers. 
vii 
The energy sector continues to strengthen in the Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts. In the Kansas City district, the count of active oil and gas rigs has risen to its highest level in 10 years; in the Minneapolis district, oil and gas exploration has remained above year- ago levels in response to higher prices. Shortages of equipment and personnel are reported in the Dallas and Kansas City districts, and mining production is decreasing in the Minneapolis district because of softening demand and high energy costs.",1,1
2001-04-30,"A majority of Federal Reserve Districts reported sluggish to modest economic growth in February, while others generally reported mixed conditions. Growth was noted by Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Economic conditions were mixed in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis, and St. Louis reported noticeably slower economic activity. 
Consumer spending rose slightly in most Districts in January and February as retailers offered deep discounts on winter merchandise. Auto sales were generally steady, but below last year's rate. Manufacturing activity continued to decline in most of the nation, although in the Boston and Richmond Districts manufacturers reported improvement. Commercial real estate activity eased in most of the Districts reporting on that sector, but vacancy rates remain mostly steady and rents have been level or rising. Home building activity rose somewhat in New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis, but declined in St. Louis, mainly because of bad weather. Agricultural conditions in the Richmond and Dallas Districts were adversely affected by dry weather. Low grain prices and high costs for farm inputs have negatively affected farm finances in the major agricultural regions of the country. Oil and gas drilling have increased in response to higher prices, but mining activity has been cut back in the wake of slackening demand for mine output. Bank lending has been sluggish except for an increase in home mortgage refinancing. Banks in some regions across the country have tightened credit standards 
Although labor markets remain tight, over half of the Federal Reserve Districts- Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco- noted some signs of easing. Demand for manufacturing workers has been declining, and recently, demand for construction workers and information technology workers has softened. Demand remains strong for clerical workers in a variety of industries and for health care workers. Employers reported some easing in wage pressures, but they have 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on information collected before February 26, 2001. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
seen increases in health benefit costs. Higher prices for energy, especially natural gas, were noted in nearly all Districts, but price pressures for many other products do not appear to have increased. 
Consumer Spending 
Retail sales rose modestly in a majority of Federal Reserve Districts in January and February compared with the same months last year. Increased sales of general merchandise were noted by New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Decreased sales were reported by Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City. Many District Banks noted that the sales gains were driven by extensive discounting in January to clear out winter merchandise. Sales varied among major lines of merchandise. Women's apparel sold well in New York, Cleveland, and Atlanta, but these same Districts and Kansas City indicated softness in sales ofmen's apparel. Cleveland reported increased sales of electronic items, and New York reported increased sales of home furnishings. In contrast, sales of home furnishings and housewares declined in Cleveland and Kansas City. Sales decreased for appliances in Chicago and jewelry in Atlanta. 
Auto sales generally declined in the first two months of this year compared with last year, although several Districts reported that sales have improved from December. 
Auto dealers' inventories were described as high throughout the nation, and manufacturers were extending incentives to boost sales. 
Tourism activity has held up in most of the Districts that reported on this sector. Richmond indicated that business was strong at ski and shore resorts. Atlanta reported increased occupancy rates at hotels in Florida as did San Francisco for hotels in California and Hawaii. Minneapolis reported solid winter tourism activity. However, Boston reported unexpectedly weak growth in tourism in New England. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity decreased in the first two months of the year in all Districts except Boston and Richmond, where it rose modestly, and New York and San Francisco, where conditions varied among manufacturers. Falling output among makers 
iii 
ofhigh-tech equipment and motor vehicles and parts was reported by Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. Declining output for electronic products and telecommunications equipment was reported by Minneapolis and Dallas. Production of industrial equipment and building materials was falling, according to reports from Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Some improvement was noted among manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology in the Boston and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia and San Francisco noted gains among manufacturers of food products. Atlanta reported that shipyards in the District had received increased orders for both military and civilian vessels. 
Several Reserve Banks reported high inventories among the manufacturers in their Districts. Cleveland and Chicago noted excess inventories of steel. Dallas and San Francisco reported high inventories of telecommunications equipment. Kansas City indicated that inventories were above plan for most manufacturers in the District. Manufacturing firms were reported to be trimming capital spending in Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Commercial construction activity eased in most of the Districts that reported on this sector. Declining commercial contracting was noted by Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City; however, New York reported an increase, and public construction was up in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts. Commercial vacancy rates were generally reported to be steady, although Atlanta and Chicago noted some increases. More space has become available for sublet as Internet and high-tech firms have closed or reduced operations. Reports of such availability came from Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Nevertheless, commercial rents have been steady to rising in most of these districts. 
Reports on residential construction were generally positive. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported increases in home building, although gains were modest. Residential construction activity was steady in Philadelphia and Kansas City and down in St. Louis. Adverse weather was blamed for the slowdown in St. Louis. 
iv 
Sales of new and existing homes continue to be fairly brisk in many regions, bolstered by lower mortgage interest rates. Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported stepped-up home sales. Such sales were steady in the Philadelphia District, and down in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. New York and Philadelphia reported steady price appreciation for both new and existing homes, but Atlanta noted some price concessions by builders in its District. 
Agriculture 
Rising costs for farm inputs have negatively affected farm finances. Increased costs of fertilizers and pesticides were reported by Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, 
Dallas, and San Francisco. Grain production in the Richmond District has been hurt by low soil moisture levels. Dry conditions have also reduced pasturage in the District. Agricultural production in the Dallas District has also been impaired by dry weather, but recent rains have improved prospects for the wheat crop and cattle forage. In general, grain prices remain low, but cattle prices appear to be firming. 
Natural Resource Industries 
Higher prices for oil and natural gas have stimulated exploration activity in the Minneapolis District and boosted the rig count in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Drilling has been constrained by limited availability of manpower and equipment, but Kansas City reports that new equipment will soon be in service. In contrast to oil and gas production, mining remains weak as low commodity prices and high energy costs squeeze mine profitability. Minneapolis reported recent and prospective reductions in output of lead, aluminum, copper, and iron. 
Financial Services and Credit 
Bank lending, other than residential mortgage refinancing, was lackluster in most Districts. Business loan demand eased in Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Commercial banks in the San Francisco District reported decreased demand for business loans for capital spending and plant expansion and increased demand for asset-based loans. New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland indicated that commercial and industrial 
loan demand in their Districts has been steady. Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco reported that business loan demand has been restrained as firms in a variety of industries have cancelled or postponed plans to expand their operations. In particular, high-tech, telecommunication, and Internet firms have scaled back their activities. 
Consumer lending decreased in Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis. Chicago noted an increase in credit card usage and outstanding balances. Mortgage lending for home purchases rose in New York and Chicago, fell in Philadelphia and Atlanta, and was steady in Kansas City. As mortgage rates have fallen, refinancing activity was reported to have picked up in New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. 
Commercial banks in several Districts have tightened credit standards. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco noted that banks in those Districts had tightened standards and stepped up monitoring ofborrowers, especially for business loans and commercial real estate loans. Banks in the St. Louis District indicated that nonperforming loans have increased, but banks in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported that loan quality has been steady. 
Employment and Wages 
Most Reserve Banks continue to describe labor markets in their Districts as tight, but a number noted recent signs of easing. Greater availability of workers was noted by 
Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Demand for manufacturing workers fell in Cleveland, Kansas City, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Hiring of construction workers eased in Kansas City. Demand for information technology specialists declined in Boston. Demand decreased for temporary workers in a variety of industries in Boston and Chicago, although Richmond reported that the market for temporary workers there was mixed. Strong demand persists for clerical workers in many industries in New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco. Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported that nurses and other health care workers remain in high demand. 
Employers reported some easing of wage pressures in Boston, New York, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Employers in San Francisco have reduced or eliminated signing bonuses. Despite easing wage pressures, employee benefit costs, especially for 
health insurance, continue to rise. New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated that businesses in their Districts are facing large increases. 
Prices 
Several Reserve Banks noted lower retail prices during January as stores offered deep discounts to sell winter goods. In February, retail prices were more stable. Nearly all Districts reported higher energy and natural gas prices. In most Districts, firms indicated that they have not passed higher fuel and energy costs on to their customers, but businesses in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts have been raising prices or imposing surcharges to cover the additional costs. According to reports received by Reserve Banks, price pressures have not increased for most products other than energy and petroleum-based commodities. Boston noted some increases in metals prices and New York reported higher software prices. Steel makers in the Chicago District have announced price increases.",1,1
2001-02-28,"Reports from Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic growth slowed in December, easing labor shortages somewhat and limiting price pressures for finished goods and services. Most districts reported a further deceleration in growth from the previous survey. Philadelphia reported an actual decline in activity, while Cleveland said that economic growth remained at the same slow rate as in the previous report. New York and San Francisco indicated that growth remained solid but showed some signs of softening. 
Despite heavy discounting, nearly all districts reported lackluster retail sales growth during the holiday season. Automobile sales slowed substantially and most districts reported a sizable buildup of dealer stocks. All districts reported weaker manufacturing activity in December. Residential construction cooled in most districts but remained strong in New York and San Francisco. Commercial real estate activity also showed some signs of slowing. The tourism industry reported a strong start to the winter season, but other service activity weakened, particularly for trucking and other transport. Activity in the energy sector expanded as fast as drillers could find workers and rigs. Banks did not report any deterioration in credit quality but kept a watchful eye over their loans. 
Labor markets eased somewhat but remained tight. Layoffs in a wide variety of industries were announced in most districts. However, business contacts expected laid-off workers to be quickly reabsorbed due to strong pent-up demand for labor at other firms. In most districts, wage pressures were similar to or slightly less intense than those in the previous survey. Prices for

most manufactured goods were flat to down despite higher costs for energy and other inputs. Consumer product prices were constrained by heavy holiday discounting. 
Consumer Spending 
Holiday retail sales were disappointing in nearly all districts, despite early and extensive discounting. Most districts reported that sales were up only slightly from the holiday season a year ago, when strong gains were reported. An exception was the New York district, where sales increases were on or close to plan. The overall weak sales growth led several national and regional retailers to close some or all of their stores. Many districts cited diminished consumer confidence as the biggest reason for the slower growth in activity this December. Retailers in the Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas districts reported that brutally cold weather further dampened sales. Winter weather items sold very well in December, as did apparel in most districts. But sales of home furnishings, fine jewelry, computers, and most other items lagged. Kansas City and San Francisco reported significant growth in online retailing during the 2000 holiday season, although the growth was below expectations in the San Francisco district. Inventory levels were reported to be satisfactory to slightly excessive in most districts. Managers seemed confident, however, that any surpluses would be trimmed during January clearance sales. Looking ahead, most store managers seemed cautiously optimistic about retail sales in the first quarter of 2001. 
Automobile sales in all districts reporting on such activity were characterized as either weak or slowing. Sales of domestic cars and light trucks were reported to be especially weak in the Philadelphia and Chicago districts. St. Louis noted that used car dealerships experienced the largest decline in sales. Dealers in the Kansas City district had difficulties moving all makes and 
iii 
models of motor vehicles. Inventories of unsold cars throughout the country were high, and in most districts expectations for auto sales in coming months remained subdued. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity weakened in all districts in December. Steel producers were reported to be in difficulty in many districts, with Cleveland and Chicago reporting a number of bankruptcy filings among steel firms. There were also announcements in several districts of temporary auto assembly plant shutdowns in the first quarter. Slower construction activity in recent months has precipitated a dropoff in production of construction-related materials and equipment in the Boston, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. On a positive note, activity at many of the nation's refineries remained solid. Production of computer-related equipment remained strong in the Boston district, but Dallas reported a sharp falloff in computer production, due to weaker consumer demand for PCs and to reductions of technology-related investment by businesses. 
High input costs, the strong dollar, and weaker domestic demand were cited the most often as reasons for the slowdown in factory activity. Boston, Richmond, and St. Louis reported that higher input costs were squeezing profits for some firms. Half the districts also mentioned widespread concern among manufacturers about higher energy costs. Some fertilizer, chemical, and smelting plants in the St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco districts have even shut down in order to resell their electricity or natural gas supplies on the open market. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City reported that heavy import competition, due largely to the strength ofthe dollar, was hampering manufacturing sales. 
Atlanta also reported that uncertainty about the U.S. stock market was adversely affecting firms' capital expenditure plans. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential real estate activity cooled in most districts. Single-family residential construction remained strong in the New York and San Francisco districts, but it declined in the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts and showed signs of slowing elsewhere. Homebuilders in the Cleveland district reported that they have far fewer projects scheduled for coming months than at the same time last year. In contrast, builders in the New York district reported a persistent backlog of projects. Home sales were mixed across housing markets, with New York again reporting the most robust activity. Boston and Richmond reported that reduced consumer confidence was adversely affecting sales, with potential homebuyers showing greater willingness to delay home purchases. Unusually cold weather was also reported to have held down activity in some districts. 
There were also signs of slowing in commercial real estate activity in some districts. Commercial construction slowed in the Dallas, Richmond, and Atlanta districts, and was 
described as mixed in the St. Louis and Cleveland districts. Commercial building remained solid in the Kansas City district. New York and Richmond reported that contraction by dot-com enterprises has helped free up some office space, although the office market in the New York district remains very tight. Shortages of office space were also reported in parts of the Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts. 
Tourism and Services 
Tourism was better than expected in those districts reporting activity. Unusually cold weather and a good snow base boosted visits to ski resorts in the Richmond and Minneapolis districts. Atlanta also reported that holiday travel to Florida was very strong. 
Activity in other service industries was generally down. Demand for trucking services fell considerably in the New York and Cleveland districts, and was down slightly in the Dallas district. Meanwhile, trucking firms' fuel, insurance, and labor costs continued to rise, resulting in an increase in bankruptcies and truck repossessions in the New York district. St. Louis reported a slowdown in barge traffic on the Mississippi River due to low water levels. Richmond and Dallas reported that revenues fell at most business service firms. In contrast, revenues were up in the Boston district's insurance industry. 
Financial Services 
Bank loan growth slowed somewhat in most districts in December. Bankers in the Cleveland district said decisions by some manufacturing firms to delay investment projects had 
reduced demand for business loans. Atlanta and Chicago also reported some slowing in business loan demand. New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported somewhat weaker demand for both consumer and business loans, while Dallas reported that demand slowed for all categories except loans to energy firms. Demand for home mortgages was mixed, but lenders in several districts said they expect refinancing activity to pick up if low mortgage rates persist. 
There were no new reports of decreases in credit quality, but banks generally continued to tighten credit standards and said they were keeping a watchful eye on the financial condition of their borrowers. Banks in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas districts 
reported they were continuing to tighten their credit standards. Banks in many districts also said they were monitoring credit quality carefully to detect any deterioration. Bankers in the Chicago district reported they were keeping an especially close eye on loans to retail and manufacturing sectors, while bankers in the Richmond district said they were paying special attention to loans to cyclical industries. 
Natural Resources and Agriculture 
The energy sector continues to expand. Despite recent easing in oil prices, contacts in the Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts reported that oil and natural gas prices remain sufficiently high to promote continued expansion of exploration and production. However, Dallas and Kansas City reported that the pace of industry expansion is constrained by worker and equipment shortages. Given these shortages, the recent dramatic rise in natural gas prices is not expected to produce a further acceleration in drilling activity. Other extraction industries are not doing as well, as metal mining and processing activity in the Minneapolis district continued to decline in the face of falling commodity prices and high electricity costs. 
In the farm economy, the onset of winter weather across the country has had mixed effects. Minneapolis reported that moisture from heavy snowfalls has benefited the winter wheat crop and is expected to reduce the likelihood of drought conditions in the coming growing season. However, severe winter weather also contributed to a worsening in pasture conditions for livestock and an increased use of alternative forages in the Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts. The alternative supplies seem to be generally available except for some reports of hay shortages in the Dallas district. 
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices 
Labor markets eased somewhat but remained tight in most districts. Layoffs in a wide variety of industries were announced in most districts. Due to strong pent-up demand for labor at other firms, however, contacts in most districts expected laid-off workers to be quickly reabsorbed. Contacts in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City districts also expressed hope that recent dot-com layoffs would alleviate the severe shortage of information technology workers. Businesses that were still having difficulty finding qualified workers included retailers in the New York and Cleveland districts, construction firms in the New York and San Francisco districts, and health care firms in the Atlanta district. In contrast, service firms in the Chicago district said they were having more success in finding qualified workers in the last few weeks of the year, and firms in the St. Louis district reported that the slowdown in demand in the district was making it easier to fill vacancies. 
Wage pressures in most districts either held steady or decreased slightly in response to the easing in labor markets. Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco all reported some moderation in overall wage pressures. New York described wage pressures as strong but steady, while Minneapolis reported that wages continued to increase at a moderate pace. Despite the overall slowdown in economic growth, a number of districts reported strong wage pressures for certain types of workers, including information technology workers in the Boston district, retail workers in the Richmond district, construction workers in the San Francisco district, and union workers in the Cleveland district. 
Price pressures for consumer goods were subdued, while prices for most manufactured goods were flat to down despite higher input costs. Extensive discounting by retailers during the 
holiday shopping season helped constrain consumer prices in most districts. Retail prices 
viii 
increased at a slower rate in the Richmond district, held steady in the Boston district, and declined somewhat in the Kansas City and Dallas districts. Manufacturers in many districts reported that their input costs rose in December, especially for energy, but that they were unable to pass these cost increases on to customers due to intense foreign and domestic competition and slowing demand. The most notable reports of downward pressure on selling prices were for steel firms in the Cleveland and Chicago districts and for a wide variety of manufacturing firms in the Dallas district, including producers of metals, cement and concrete, paper, and lumber. In the service-producing sector, telecommunications firms in the Dallas district reported their prices were falling rapidly, but insurance firms in the Boston district said that reduced price competition had enabled them to raise premiums to more profitable levels.",0,0
2000-11-30,"Reports from Federal Reserve Banks generally described the regional economies as growing at a moderate pace during September and early October, but with additional signs of slowing growth in some areas. Activity in Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston was reported as growing at a moderate rate. The pace of activity had eased in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, while San Francisco and New York reported solid expansion in most industries. 
Retail spending softened slightly in some Districts and the outlook was a little less positive for the tourism sector. Manufacturing activity was generally steady, but some reports noted continuing problems because of labor shortages, higher fuel prices, and competition from imports. Residential housing sales and construction activity continued to slow in most of the country. Commercial real estate markets remained generally healthy, but some reports indicated that activity might be slowing. Reports on agriculture were mixed, while the energy sector strengthened considerably. Labor markets remained stretched, and some Districts indicated increasing wage pressures. Reports also noted higher petroleum-based manufacturing input costs, although strong competition amongst producers continued to prevent the majority of firms from passing on much ofthe cost increases to their customers. 
Consumer Spending: Retail sales have generally slowed from earlier in the year and growth is described as modest. Retailers in New York and Richmond noted some pickup in the volume of sales recently. In the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia Districts, recent sales figures had met merchants' expectations. Inventory levels were described as balanced in 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before October 23, 2000. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Atlanta, Dallas, New York, and Philadelphia, while inventories were somewhat higher than desired in Chicago and Kansas City. Reports on apparel sales were mixed, but early cool weather contributed to some pickup in sales volume. More broadly, the retail outlook has become increasingly conservative since the last report. Merchants in the Atlanta District expect fourth-quarter sales growth will be modest. Dallas District retailers lowered their outlook for the next six months, while retailers in the Chicago region anticipate consumers will have less money to spend because of higher home heating costs this winter. However, merchants in Boston remained generally optimistic about sales growth through the end of the first quarter of next year, and retailers in Cleveland and Kansas City anticipated strong year-end sales. 
Reports on recent vehicle sales were mixed but still at generally high levels. Sales in Kansas City were up slightly in September and early October, and dealers were largely successful at managing inventories during the model year changeover period. Auto sales were better than a year ago in Chicago, and inventories were under control. Sales were reported to have slowed in Philadelphia and Dallas, and to have been slightly below last year's record levels in Cleveland. 
Services and Tourism: The service sector continued to post solid growth, but attracting and retaining employees remained difficult. Boston noted that the pace of restructuring in the insurance industry has slowed, and little additional retrenchment is planned. Some contacts reported difficulty in finding and retaining employees in information technology and systems areas. There was some softening of revenue growth for service firms in the Richmond District. Dallas reported that the demand for transportation services remained strong even with fuel surcharges, and in San Francisco, there was strong demand for most services. 
iii 
The outlook for the tourism and hospitality industry was a little less upbeat for the Atlanta and Richmond Districts; both reports expressed concern that rising fuel prices could discourage winter tourists. Minneapolis reported that fall season tourism in its District was on par with a year ago. San Francisco noted that healthy growth in tourism to Hawaii was boosting hotel occupancy rates and room prices. 
Construction and Real Estate: Most reports stated that the level of activity in single- family housing markets continued at a healthy level despite slowing sales and construction activity. There have been scattered reports of rising home inventories in the Atlanta, Boston, and St. Louis regions, and some price concessions were reported in the Atlanta District. The Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco Districts reported some pickup in housing activity. Generally, contacts anticipated the market would remain strong, although the pace of 
construction and home sales was expected to decline further through year-end. Overall, commercial real estate markets continued to perform well, although there is increasing evidence that construction levels are waning a bit. Contractors in the Atlanta region 
noted that construction backlogs had declined, and construction has slowed in the St. Louis District. Vacancy rates retreated slightly in parts of the Atlanta, Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco Districts. Site and utility inquiries have declined significantly in central Indiana. Contract work shrank in the Dakotas and Minnesota. In Manhattan, New York, despite rapidly escalating office rents, only a moderate volume of new construction is planned over the next few years. 
Manufacturing: Manufacturing activity was generally steady, with only a few areas of continuing weakness. Atlanta, Dallas, Boston, and San Francisco reported expanding activity in the high-tech sector. Manufacturers' capital spending plans were strong in Philadelphia and 
Boston, while St. Louis and Atlanta reported expansions in light vehicle production facilities. Although overall manufacturing conditions remain favorable in the New York and San Francisco Districts, weakness in the euro had reduced orders for some manufactured goods. The pace of manufacturing activity was increasing in Kansas City and Minneapolis. Strong demand for household appliances led to a factory expansion in the St. Louis District, while large shipyard contracts were boosting activity in the Atlanta District. San Francisco reported strong sales in the aerospace, semiconductor, and pharmaceutical industries. Refineries were operating at near capacity in New York and Dallas. Less favorably, paper and lumber mill production was slowing and inventories were accumulating according to Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Chicago reported that an increase in imports led to slower steel production and softer pricing. Heavy-duty truck producers continued to cut back output in Cleveland and Chicago because of a weaker volume of new orders. In Philadelphia, working hours have been reduced at many manufacturing plants, and inventories have risen. Atlanta noted that the downsizing of the apparel industry continued. 
Banking and Finance: Growth of loan demand remained strong in most Districts, but with some softening noted. Overall lending activity was reported as solid in Chicago and Atlanta, and stable in the New York District. Total loans outstanding were up slightly according to St. Louis. Richmond, Kansas City, and Philadelphia reported that growth of lending activity slackened in September and early October. In Dallas, contacts reported that the pace of financial sector activity was slower than a year ago. 
In New York, there was a slight pickup in commercial and industrial sector loans, and in Philadelphia and Cleveland, banks reported slight increases in business lending activity. Refinancing activity continued to decrease in New York, Kansas City, and Philadelphia, but 
increased in Chicago in recent weeks. Atlanta and New York reported further weakening in demand for both residential and nonresidential mortgages. Real estate and consumer loan demand remained unchanged in St. Louis. 
Many contacts continued to express concerns about credit quality, although most reported that overall credit quality was still at healthy levels. In New York, credit standards were tightened further on commercial and industrial borrowers. Commercial lenders in Richmond were monitoring hotel and other commercial real estate loans closely. Chicago reported that business-lending standards remained tighter than earlier in the year. In Atlanta, there were expectations that third- and fourth-quarter credit losses would rise. San Francisco reported that credit quality was generally good, but there was some tightening of credit conditions for commercial real estate lending. Lending standards were generally unchanged in Kansas City. In Philadelphia, credit quality for both business and personal loan portfolios has been steady. 
Labor Markets and Prices: Labor markets remained taut, and some reports cited notable upward pressure on wages. In Philadelphia, firms were having considerable trouble finding qualified workers, and many companies raised wages in greater amounts this year than in the past few years. The skilled labor shortage also remained a problem in Boston and Richmond, and employment agencies reported trouble filling job openings in New York. Dallas indicated that while labor markets remained tight, the recent shake-up of Internet companies had freed up some high-tech workers in the District. In Kansas City, employers were increasingly using flexible work schedules to attract and retain workers. Minneapolis reported widespread concern over worker availability and retention. In Cleveland, contacts noted strong wage increases in fast growing companies. Employees at all skill levels remained in short supply in San Francisco and St. Louis, with notable upward pressure on wages. 
Petroleum-based input prices rose recently, but strong competition has reportedly prevented many firms from passing on much of the cost increases to customers, except in transportation and certain other areas. Rising costs resulted in increased pressure on profitability for firms in the Atlanta, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts. Price pressures had reportedly diminished somewhat in New York, and with the exception of energy, most prices were stable in Dallas. Cleveland, Kansas City, and Atlanta reported declining building materials prices, such as lumber and drywall. Strong import competition has 
been keeping prices flat in San Francisco. In contrast, Boston noted that some manufacturers were passing on more of their increasing costs to customers than in previous reports. The increasing cost of health and other insurance programs continued to be reported as a concern in 
Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Agriculture and Natural Resources: Oil and natural gas exploration and production 
were reported at high levels in the Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. Agricultural production results varied greatly across the Districts. St. Louis reported that cotton estimates for District states were below normal for October, reflecting a smaller-than-expected increase in harvested acres and a sizeable drop in yield this year. In the Dallas District, much of the cotton and sorghum crop has been declared a total loss. Recent rains also came too late for many crop farmers throughout the Atlanta District. On the other hand, record corn and soybean harvests are expected in Kansas City, and Chicago reported that October's corn and soybean production in the District is expected to be up 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively, from a year ago. Farmers in North Carolina and Virginia made good progress harvesting the peanut and cotton crops. Pasture and livestock conditions ranged from fair to excellent in West Virginia.",0,0
2000-10-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in August and early September, even though further 
signs of slowing growth were noted in several Districts. Most Districts characterized economic conditions as strong and several said that economic growth continued to be 
solid. Richmond reported that growth had picked up from earlier in the summer. In contrast, reports from Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis indicated that the overall pace of growth had softened in their Districts. Consumer spending was flat to modestly higher in most Districts in August compared with late spring and early summer. Several Districts noted that sales growth strengthened in early September. Manufacturing activity generally grew on pace, despite the recent shutdown of a few automobile assembly plants because of a lack of tires. Home sales and construction continued to soften, but several Districts reported that commercial real estate activity was robust. Overall loan demand remained strong, as firmer business demand more than offset continued weak mortgage activity. In agriculture, crop prices remained low and yield prospects dimmed in areas of the Southeast and Midwest experiencing prolonged drought conditions. Oil field and mining activity grew rapidly in several Districts. 
Labor markets remained tight in most Districts, although signs of some easing were reported by Boston and Kansas City. Reports of wage increases were widespread and some firms indicated that higher labor costs were an increasing problem. Nevertheless, there were few indications that higher wages were being passed through to consumers as higher productivity and competitive pressures held firms' prices in check.

However, several Districts indicated that the recent sharp increases in the costs of health care and energy might eventually be passed through to consumers. In contrast, reports from several Districts noted that prices of some metals, lumber, and other basic commodities had declined in recent weeks. 
Consumer Spending: Several Districts reported sluggish retail sales growth during August, although expectations for sales through year-end were upbeat. Reports noted that apparel sales had been particularly weak in late summer. However, strong back-to-school sales in the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, and improved sales of electronics in some areas, appeared to have boosted activity recently. Chicago said that overall retail sales grew at a rate above the national average, while Philadelphia and Atlanta indicated that sales fell short of retailers' expectations. Retailers' inventories were described as ""in balance"" and ""at desired levels."" Sales of electronics were generally higher, except in the San Francisco District, where they were flat. Despite a spate of manufacturers' incentives, automobile sales were slower in Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. In Philadelphia, overall auto sales also eased, but luxury cars were selling well. In Cleveland and Richmond, auto sales picked up. Retail prices were steady in most Districts. Tourism and travel were softer in Richmond, partly due to memories of last year's storms, and in Montana where forest fires kept outdoors vacationers at bay. In contrast, tourism was stronger in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts. 
Services: Reports indicated that business activity in services industries generally increased. Service providers in San Francisco ""noted an acceleration in growth above an already rapid trend."" Internet-related firms displayed strength in the Boston, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts. In Dallas, demand facing transportation firms 
remained robust. Labor shortages persisted, especially ofemployees with technology- related skills. The outlier was Boston, which reported that some layoffs in ""dot-coms"" had eased the labor shortages facing more established firms. District reports indicated that wage pressures have had little effect on final prices. Employers in Atlanta and Chicago expressed concern about higher health care benefits costs. Surging electricity prices were raising costs in the San Francisco District. New York reported, however, that there was some leveling off of previously skyrocketing electricity prices. 
Construction/Real Estate: Most reports indicated that residential construction had softened further and that sales were flat or lower on a year-over-year basis. In contrast, Dallas reported strengthening residential conditions and Richmond and Kansas City reported stronger sales of higher-priced homes. In most Districts, inventories of houses have declined in recent weeks. 
In the commercial real estate sector, reports from Boston and Philadelphia indicated that new construction had slowed, but that rents continued to rise in markets facing strong demand for space. New York reported that a severe shortage of office space in Manhattan continued to keep availability rates at historic lows. Boston contacts also reported low levels of office space availability in New England because of strong demand and relatively little new construction. In contrast, reports from Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco indicated that new construction had kept pace with rising demand. 
Manufacturing: Manufacturing activity remained generally strong, although there were reports of moderation in some Districts. Over half of the Districts indicated that output at factories increased modestly to strongly, while Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted signs of softening activity. Tire recalls led to shutdowns at automobile assembly plants near St. Louis and in Minnesota for two and 
three weeks, respectively. District reports suggested that the light vehicle, aircraft, industrial machinery, and construction and building industries demonstrated substantial vigor, while the production of heavy trucks fell. Assessments of the furniture, appliances, and apparel industries were mixed. Reports indicated that increases in input costs were more widespread, particularly for paper, transportation, and energy-related goods. Boston and Minneapolis reported that input prices had increased for paper, while Atlanta said that rising energy prices had boosted transportation costs. The majority of the Districts noted that increased fuel and energy prices continued to raise production costs. Despite rising costs for inputs, competitive pressure prevented manufacturers in most Districts from raising prices. 
Banking/Finance: Overall lending activity remained strong in most Districts, despite sluggish demand for residential mortgages in many areas. Chicago reported brisk business lending, while Philadelphia said that commercial lending had advanced at a fairly steady pace in recent months. Atlanta characterized commercial loan demand as ""brisk,"" but noted that it was less vigorous than in previous quarters. Overall consumer lending was said to be strong in the Atlanta District and relatively robust in Chicago. Automobile loans were the fastest growing category of lending in Dallas and ""quite strong"" in Cleveland. Residential mortgage lending, on the other hand, slipped in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis. New York reported that demand for all types of loans had fallen since their last report. 
Several Districts reported that credit conditions had tightened. New York said that credit standards were generally tighter, particularly on commercial and industrial loans. Chicago reported that bank contacts indicated that credit standards were being tightened, but said that competition had constrained ""how far they could go."" Philadelphia noted 
that some banks said they would consider implementing more restrictive credit standards in the fourth quarter if business conditions weakened. There were only a few reports of changes in delinquency rates; Cleveland said that some contacts had reported a rise in loan delinquencies because of higher debt burdens, while New York reported a decline in delinquency rates. 
Labor Markets: Most Districts reported that labor markets remained tight. Several Districts continued to report that administrative workers with computer skills and 
information technology (IT) professionals were in short supply. New York cited a severe shortage of computer ""techies"" as well as unmet demand for office workers. However, 
Boston reported that layoffs at dot-coms and other start-ups were helping temporary employment firms meet the strong demand for employees from more established firms. 
In Atlanta, skilled labor such as nurses and IT professionals were said to be in short supply. In that District, businesses relied increasingly on overtime and investment in labor-saving technology to help counter labor shortages. Chicago noted that competition for qualified workers remained intense in most areas. Recruiting and retaining employees remained difficult for firms in the San Francisco District where rapid employee turnover and rising wage and benefit costs were tempering profits. Firms in that District were said to be considering additional investment in labor-saving technologies. 
Most Districts said that wages edged up in August and early September. Boston said that firms had increased spending on benefits to retain workers, while New York reported that salaries for office workers were up more than 10 percent from a year ago. Wage pressures in Kansas City eased from earlier in the year although some firms were still offering sizable signing bonuses. Richmond indicated that wage pressures had intensified because of a continued strong demand for workers. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources: Drought conditions in many areas of the Midwest and Southeast ravaged crops and impeded livestock production. Atlanta noted that production losses for some crops would run as high as 50 percent. Dallas reported that the Texas cotton crop had been declared a disaster-one million acres of the usual 6.3 million planted had been abandoned. Chicago and St. Louis said that dry weather had resulted in lower-than-expected corn yields. In contrast, Cleveland and Richmond reported that farmers expected higher-than-normal corn and soybean yields this year, and in Minneapolis, a potential bumper crop had farmers scrambling for storage space. Nearly half the Districts reported that low prices, caused in part by bumper yields, remained a concern for corn and soybean producers. 
Dry weather in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts hindered livestock production. Dallas indicated that producers were providing supplemental feed and hauling water to livestock. Both Dallas and San Francisco reported that livestock farmers were paring herds. In Cleveland, however, dairy and livestock farmers reported excellent production. In Kansas City, strong consumer demand for meat continued to support livestock prices, while San Francisco noted that stable prices for beef cattle had benefited ranchers in that District. 
Reports from Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated that oil-drilling activity continued to increase rapidly. Dallas noted that international drilling activity was also rising, but that it remained well below the peak levels of 1997 and 1998. Minneapolis reported that the iron ore and palladium industries continued to operate at full capacity, but that huge increases in electricity costs had halted production at a copper mine in Montana until at least November.",0,0
2000-08-31,"The information collected for these reports suggests that economic activity in all Federal Reserve Districts continued to expand in June and July, but there were additional signs that the expansion was moderating in some sectors and the majority of Districts. Seven Districts-Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco-reported slowing economic growth. Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia Districts reported basically no change in the growth rates, and the St. Louis District reported accelerating economic growth. 
District reports suggest consumer spending, manufacturing, and construction were slightly softer than in the last report. Easing demand appears to be restraining price increases. Energy prices remain high but may have peaked, and reports suggest that most of the indirect costs of rising energy prices have been absorbed by final goods producers for the time being. Labor markets continue to be very tight, and there are indications that the shortage of workers is limiting growth of activity in some areas. Many Districts reported wage increases and the growing use of benefits. 
Consumer Spending. Reports of softness in consumer spending are more prevalent than in the last Beige Book. Most Districts reported that retail sales growth was unchanged or lower, but the Kansas City District reported a pick up in retail sales in June and July. Retailers in the Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, and New York Districts indicated that sales were below plan. Sales of apparel and seasonal items were noted as areas of weakness, while areas of strength

ii included electronics, household goods, furniture and jewelry. Reports do not generally suggest 
a problem with excess inventories, although the New York District reported excess inventories of summer wear and air conditioners. 
Vehicle sales slowed in the Dallas, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, as well as rural parts of the Kansas City District. The Philadelphia District said dealer inventories had increased slightly. In contrast, the St. Louis District reported that auto sales had rebounded from a slow start this year. 
Manufacturing. District reports from manufacturers were mixed but suggest slowing since the last Beige Book. Four Districts-Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and Richmond- 
reported that manufacturing activity fell or grew more slowly, while activity was unchanged in four Districts-Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. However, manufacturing activity grew in the Boston, New York, and St. Louis Districts. Atlanta reported mixed conditions. 
Sales of construction equipment and inputs remained strong in some Districts, such as Boston and Cleveland, but slowed in other Districts. Demand has softened for some durable 
goods, such as heavy equipment, agricultural equipment, lumber, and metals. Paper producers in the Dallas District reported weaker demand, including a significant drop in demand for boxes and packing paper. In contrast, the San Francisco District reported strong sales of wood pulp and paper products. Semiconductors, computers, and other high-tech equipment continued to be in high demand, as were some nondurables, such as food. 
Services. Demand for services remained high in the Districts reporting on that sector. Tourism was strong in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts. Transportation firms in the Dallas, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts also 
iii reported strong or increased business. Contacts in both the transportation and tourism 
industries noted that higher fuel prices did not appear to be restraining demand. Firms employing temporary workers in the Richmond and Dallas Districts reported continued strong demand for their services. Temporary employment firms in the Dallas District said growth was restrained by their inability to hire workers. 
Construction and Real Estate. Home building and real estate activity slowed in most Districts, but several noted that activity continued at high levels. Nine Districts reported slower residential construction-Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Sales of existing homes were weaker in six Districts-Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis. 
Commercial construction activity grew at a slower pace in Chicago and San Francisco, but continued to be brisk in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Richmond Districts. Lenders in the Atlanta District are becoming more cautious and are requiring a higher level of pre-leasing. Contacts in the Dallas District complained that lenders are restraining construction funding because they fear overbuilding. 
Banking and Finance. Loan demand remained strong or ""solid"" in most Districts, although several banks reported areas of slowing loan demand. Demand for real estate loans or mortgage refinancing slowed or fell in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, New York, and Richmond Districts. Consumer lending was weaker or fell in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts. Growth in business loans was slower in the Philadelphia District, while the Richmond District reported fewer commercial loans in the ""pipeline."" 
iv Banks in the Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts reported difficulty 
obtaining deposits. In the St. Louis District, the lack of deposit growth continues to be the biggest challenge facing banks, and many have turned to Federal Home Loan Banks to obtain funds to meet loan demand. The Philadelphia District reports that bankers are facing growing competition for personal accounts from brokerage firms and mutual funds. 
A few banks noted an increase in concerns about credit quality. Bankers in the Kansas City, New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts mentioned tighter credit standards. Commercial lenders in the Richmond District said they were taking a closer look at the creditworthiness of borrowers in cyclical industries. Some bankers in the Chicago District noted a slight ""step back"" in loan quality, although they stressed that overall loan quality remained high. The Atlanta, Dallas, and Cleveland Districts reported no change in credit quality. 
The San Francisco District reports that contacts in Washington State say Internet retailers are having more difficulty accessing venture capital; it is reportedly more difficult to obtain financing for large and unproven businesses, while quality small- and medium-sized borrowers had no difficulty obtaining loans. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Agricultural production has been mostly favorable according to the Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. Yields are expected to be above average in many areas. Still, agricultural conditions are uneven, and in parts of the country it has been feast or famine with rainfall. Several Districts reported areas of severe drought, while in a few other areas excess rainfall has been a problem. For many crops, the expectation of bumper yields has pushed down prices, and the Dallas and Cleveland Districts say many farmers expect low or 
no profit for the year. Livestock producers are in better shape as beef and hog prices have increased while low crop prices have reduced feed costs. 
Energy activity expanded in the Districts reporting on the sector. Exploration and development of oil and natural gas increased in the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. The Dallas District reports that natural gas is still the main driver for drilling activity in the United States, but oil-directed activity has begun to pick up for the first time since U.S. drilling activity turned around 16 months ago. Weak international drilling is putting downward pressure on pricing for some oil field products and drilling services, however. Minneapolis reported that the iron ore and platinum industries continue to operate near capacity. 
Labor Markets. Nearly all Districts report that labor markets remain very tight, and the labor shortage has become more severe in the Boston and Kansas City Districts. Difficulty obtaining workers was restraining employment growth in the Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts. 
The shortage of workers is reported across all types of industries, including manufacturing, services, transportation, construction, energy extraction, and information technology. Several Districts mentioned difficulty obtaining retail workers. A retailer in the Richmond District said it is a challenge to find reliable employees, adding that some ""employees just don't show up for work."" A Dallas District retailer said the lack of employee experience is hurting sales. A staffing service contact in the Chicago area said that meeting its customers' needs for workers was ""like torture."" 
Most Districts said wages, benefits or incentives were growing and becoming more creative. Signing bonuses are becoming larger for both skilled and unskilled workers at many 
V 
vi firms in the St. Louis District, and some fast food chains are offering free meals, regular pay 
raises, paid training and profit sharing. The San Francisco District reports that there were few instances in which wage increases were outstripping productivity gains but there had been a pickup in benefit costs. A grocery store chain in the Dallas District has addressed advertisements to parents suggesting that they encourage their children to become employees because the chain offers good pay, flexible hours, and extensive benefits, including college tuition. 
Prices. Manufacturers and retailers say input costs have risen, particularly for energy, transportation, and products linked to oil. The Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts report, however, that in most instances these price increases are not being passed along to customers, partly because of competitive pressures. The Boston District says offsetting cost savings and productivity increases are mitigating price pressures. Some companies cite examples of negotiating volume discounts with their suppliers, making expanded use of electronic purchasing, or shifting production to foreign locations. Price pressures from the energy industry appear to have pulled back some, as the Dallas District reported that the steam has generally come out of energy prices. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, and retail and wholesale gasoline peaked in June and July. 
Despite some increase in input cost pressures, all Districts reporting on the retail industry said selling prices were unchanged or lower, with the exception of the Richmond District. Retailers in the New York District were surprised that shipping costs had not increased, or at least not significantly. The Chicago and New York Districts say retailers were doing more promotions and price discounting. The Chicago District noted that an increase in inventories had led the auto industry to increase incentive spending. 
vii The Cleveland and Dallas Districts report a drop in steel prices, with the Cleveland 
District explaining that steel prices have fallen to their first-quarter levels; producers cite high inventories at ""steel service centers."" Several Districts noted that builder's reports of materials shortages had dissipated. The Boston and Dallas Districts report that lumber prices were lower. 
A couple of Districts reported higher real estate prices, and the Atlanta District says health care insurance premiums and pharmaceutical prices continued to escalate at double-digit rates.",0,1
2000-07-31,"Retail sales are higher in all Districts than a year ago. However, half of the Districts report a recent slowdown in the rate of growth. All four of the Districts mentioning the tourist 
sector (Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis) said that tourism spending continues to be strong. A majority of Districts said that autos and durable goods exhibited weaker sales growth 
and a corresponding increase in inventories for some of these big ticket items. Despite the recent slowdown, retailers in the St. Louis, Richmond, and Boston Districts remain optimistic concerning the strength of consumer demand, while retailers in the Dallas District are revising downward their earlier projections of spending growth. 
Merchants in all Districts report very tight labor markets for retail workers, with corresponding pressures to increase wages in order to attract employees. Districts mentioning wage increases in the retail sector said they were in the 3 to 7 percent range, with double-digit wage growth in highly skilled occupations and among seasonal workers. Tourist-related businesses are said to be having great difficulty filling seasonal positions. 
Retailers in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts say that wage inflation is not carrying over to prices. Of those, all but Chicago indicate 
that prices for consumer goods are mostly stable. Retailers in Chicago report that prices are rising modestly. However, retail contacts in Cleveland said that increased supply costs are being passed along, raising consumer goods prices faster than previously. By contrast, Richmond reports that price increases have eased in the retail sector. Manufacturing 
Most Districts report that overall manufacturing activity is rising. Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco report a slight weakening but describe conditions as ""strong"" or ""solid."" St. 
iii 
Louis indicates that business is stable at a high level. Strong and rising demands for steel, fabricated metals, petroleum products, 
semiconductors, and high-tech equipment are mentioned frequently in District reports. Shortages of labor, materials, and capital are said to be constraining actual or expected output for manufacturers ofthese or other products in the Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Where mentioned, exports are said to be rising across a variety of products, mostly durable goods. 
Reports on the interest-sensitive automotive and construction-related sectors are mixed. Chicago and Cleveland indicate declining demand for heavy trucks. Chicago notes a slowdown in light vehicle demand (from an exceptionally high level last year); however, Atlanta reports a ramp-up in production among auto parts suppliers. Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond cite strong demand for building components and furnishings. Dallas indicates continuing strong demand for brick and glass but declines for lumber and wood products. San Francisco indicates that lumber orders are sluggish. Cleveland and Chicago mention that public sector construction is providing a boost for some manufactured products, although Chicago also reports that orders for construction equipment are down. 
Most Districts mention some evidence of increasing inflationary pressures. Prices paid for petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, paper, and some construction materials are said to be rising. However, reports generally indicate that manufacturers are raising their selling prices less than the increase in input costs. Only Richmond explicitly states that the prices of manufactured goods accelerated in the most recent survey period, describing the increase as slight. By contrast, Chicago characterizes pricing in the manufacturing sector as soft. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Districts reporting on business services generally describe demand as strong within the sector although Cleveland reports a softening in the need for temporary workers. Also, demand for legal services from dot-com companies has slowed somewhat in Dallas because of weakness in financial markets and fewer IPOs. Labor markets remain tight throughout the country. For example, software and information technology service firms in Boston report high turnover rates and difficulty competing with compensation packages offered by dot-com companies in the area. Contract employment firms in both Richmond and Boston relate that clients are increasingly using their services to fill permanent positions, because of the difficulty they are having finding workers on their own. Banking and Finance 
Most Districts report either a reduction or a slowing in the growth of loan demand, especially for mortgages. Richmond and Atlanta report softening demand for commercial loans. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas note sluggish or decreased mortgage demand. New York, Richmond, and Atlanta report decreased or soft mortgage refinancing. New York, Cleveland, and St. Louis experienced slowing of demand for consumer loans. San Francisco reports ""slightly weaker loan demand in some areas,"" and Philadelphia notes a slowing in the rate at which loan volume was increasing. Contrary to the general tone, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas report strong or increasing overall loan demand; Cleveland reports strong commercial lending activity; and Atlanta reports strong consumer and home- equity loan demand. 
Three Districts report that deposits are down, although New York notes an increase. There appears to be little change in credit standards since the last survey. 
Construction and Real Estate 
Compared to a year ago, April and May home sales were lower in more than half of the Districts. While the Richmond and St. Louis Districts report moderate slowdowns, the Kansas City District experienced a significant decline. In contrast, upstate New York had much higher sales than a year ago, and home sales in New York City declined only because of lack of inventory. The pace of residential construction was also slower in many areas. The New York District reports fewer single-family home permits in April compared to the first quarter, and sales of new homes in the Cleveland District were 5 to 10 percent lower than a year ago. By contrast, the Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts report increased construction activity. House price changes were mixed. 
Commercial real estate markets are strong, and commercial construction has escalated in many parts ofthe country. The Philadelphia and Cleveland Districts report new industrial construction, while the Atlanta District reports speculative office construction. Construction is also expanding in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, but it has slowed in the Dallas District. Office vacancy rates are very low in some metropolitan areas, mainly Boston, New York City (where record low vacancy rates were reported in Manhattan), and the San Francisco Bay area. Both office and industrial space is scarce in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. Office rental rates are increasing in Boston, Manhattan (where rents have risen at an annual rate of 35 percent so far this year), Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. Contacts in most Districts expect activity in commercial markets to continue at a high level, but predict possible further slowdowns in residential markets due to higher interest rates. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
May rains reportedly improved crop prospects in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago 
Districts. By contrast, drought-like conditions continued in most of the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, where the dry weather damaged winter wheat and created poor forage. Pastures are also dry in Arizona and Oregon. In a few areas, scarce forage has spurred ranchers to start culling their herds. Nevertheless, the corn, soybean, and other major crops are generally described as on or ahead of schedule, and in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, they are in good-to-excellent condition. Surveys in several Districts indicate that farmers' financial conditions have improved, with gains in farm values and incomes and debt repayments. Contacts in Kansas City and San Francisco noted that crop prices remain low, while those in Minneapolis and San Francisco mentioned rising wages or turnover for farm labor. 
Activity in the energy sector has improved. Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all cite sharply increased rig counts in response to low inventories, strong demand, and higher energy prices. With natural gas prices up over 50 percent year-on-year and forecast to 
rise, Dallas reports that gas is leading the sector's recovery and that drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is at late 1997 peaks. In Atlanta and Dallas, contacts note that the energy sector is having trouble hiring. The iron ore and platinum industries in the Minneapolis District are operating near capacity.",1,1
2000-05-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that the economy continued to expand during March and the first three weeks of April. The majority of Districts reported moderate to strong economic growth, with only Richmond and Chicago noting some signs that overall growth had slowed slightly. Consumer spending was strong and retail sales were in line with most merchants' expectations. Commercial construction activity generally remained robust, while several Districts noted softening demand on the residential side. Factories were running near capacity in some areas, as overall manufacturing activity was strong. Dry soil conditions were reported in many areas, but spring planting proceeded at a rapid pace. Oil drilling activity was up from a year ago. 
There were more frequent reports of intensifying wage pressures as shortages of workers persisted in all Districts. Increasing input prices were noted in nearly every region. Many Districts cited wider use of fuel surcharges by shipping firms and other transportation companies. Manufacturers in several areas also reported higher prices for petroleum-related inputs, such as rubber and plastics, as well as for some non petroleum-related inputs. However, there were only 
a few reports that increases in input costs were resulting in higher prices at the retail level. District reports generally indicated that recent volatility in equity markets had not had an 
impact on activity as of the time of this report, although it had altered some contacts' expectations. 
1Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information collected before April 24, 2000. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Consumer Spending. Retail sales generally were strong and in line with merchants' expectations. Contacts pointed out that year-over-year sales comparisons were affected by the fact Easter was later this year. Nearly all Districts reported strong sales of home-related items such as appliances, furniture, and lawn and garden equipment. The same was true for light vehicles (especially sport utility and luxury models), although pockets of softness were noted by Chicago and St. Louis. Nearly half the Districts reported that apparel sales were slow, especially men's, with unseasonable weather cited by many as a contributing factor. Inventories were in line with sales expectations for the most part. The tourism and travel industry was strong in the Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, while Minneapolis suggested that mild weather hurt their industry. 
Prices at the retail level remained relatively stable in most areas, as competition and increased productivity reportedly helped keep prices in check. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, however, noted more frequent reports of price increases in recent months. 
Construction/Real Estate. Overall construction activity remained strong, although softening residential demand was reported in many Districts. Much of this easing took place in the interior of the country, with Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City noting that residential building had slowed. In contrast, the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts experienced strong growth in recent months, and New York reported that activity was ""frenzied"" in some areas. Philadelphia noted that the lack of land approved for development appeared to be limiting the pace of homebuilding. Existing home sales also appeared to have slowed somewhat, with a third of the regions noting that the stock of houses available for sale was quite low. Home prices continued to rise, especially in the coastal regions, but also in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. 
Reports suggested that commercial construction activity remained robust in most areas, as only Dallas reported an overall slowing in its District. Minneapolis and San Francisco noted strong growth while activity was mixed in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts. Office rents were reported to be rising in the New York and San Francisco Districts. 
Manufacturing. Manufacturing activity generally was strong, but reports were mixed by both geography and industry. Richmond was the only District to report a moderation in overall activity, while Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Minneapolis noted solid gains. Activity was mixed in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, but generally remained strong. District reports indicated that light vehicles and related equipment, machine-cutting tools, steel, and high-tech hardware industries exhibited significant strength, while the agricultural equipment, heavy truck, and aerospace equipment industries were relatively soft. District reports on primary metals, fabricated metals, and textiles were mixed. Increasing foreign demand for manufactured goods was cited by Boston, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. District reports suggested that input prices were generally stable, with the oft-noted exception of increases in petroleum-related input prices. Philadelphia, however, indicated that input prices had increased for materials used in lumber, paper, chemical, and industrial equipment production. Output prices for steel continued to rise, as did prices for some construction-related materials. Wallboard prices, however, declined in the first quarter as new capacity came on stream, but prices remained solidly above year-ago levels. Cleveland and Chicago noted that factories were running near capacity while St. Louis suggested that the shortage of workers was a constraining force on their manufacturing activity. 
Banking/Finance. District reports indicated that business loan demand remained strong in March and April while, on the consumer side, residential mortgage lending was relatively soft. 
Demand for commercial and industrial loans was reported to be high in 11 Districts, while Dallas noted a slight softening. Interest rate increases were said to be delaying some commercial construction projects in Atlanta and Chicago. Contacts in virtually all Districts reported that business loan quality remained good, and some noted that banks were still tightening lending standards. Residential mortgage lending activity was generally flat to down in most areas as mortgage interest rates trended higher. New mortgage originations were down and refinancing activity remained very soft. Some Districts reported that high consumer confidence kept the demand for other types of loans (credit card, home equity, etc.) strong. Credit quality of consumer loans was also reported to be good, and improving slightly. Banks in most areas 
continued to report difficulty attracting sufficient deposits to fund loans. Labor Markets. Difficulty in finding and retaining qualified employees remained a 
common refrain in District reports as worker shortages persisted in every District, and practically every industry and occupation. Many Districts noted that the lack of available workers continued to hamper overall economic growth; and reports of employers providing retention and referral bonuses, assistance in finding child care, and health benefits were more widespread. Many Districts reported particularly severe shortages of workers in retail trade. In the San Francisco District, a retailer was reported to have received only 2 applications for over 20 job openings at a new store, and Atlanta reported that some retail chains had given store managers the leeway to set local wages competitively. Employment costs remained under pressure and appeared to intensify in the last two months. New York, Cleveland, and Chicago cited significant increases in health care costs as a contributing factor. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Farmers and ranchers in many areas were concerned about low soil moisture levels. Reports from nearly half the Districts indicated there 
were areas of dryness that had adversely affected pasture conditions and may hinder the development of recently planted field crops and vegetables. Spring planting in most Districts was generally proceeding rapidly and running either on or ahead of the average pace. Chicago and St. Louis reported that spring planting intentions were quite similar to a year ago. Kansas City and Minneapolis reported that the winter wheat crop was in good condition, but Kansas City noted that additional rainfall was needed to ensure crop development. 
The commodity price situation was mixed. Several Districts reported that farmers benefited from recent gains in hog and beef cattle prices. But low prices remained a concern for corn, soybean, and wheat producers despite some recent increases. In addition, San Francisco indicated that rising fuel prices had pushed costs higher and squeezed operating margins. Reports from Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis indicated that oil-drilling activity was stronger than a year ago. Dallas indicated that the domestic rig count might be nearing an upper limit due to availability constraints on personnel and equipment. Minneapolis reported that the iron ore and palladium mining industries were at full production, but that low prices and environmental issues plagued gold mining.",1,0
2000-04-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated appreciable expansion of economic activity during late January and February. The majority of districts reported strong growth during the survey period, with the remaining reports pointing to moderate growth or continued high levels of activity. Retail sales expanded significantly over their year-earlier levels. Gains in manufacturing output were widespread. Providers of services to businesses and consumers continued to expand output and employment substantially. Real estate market activity and construction were at high levels, although slight cooling was evident in some areas. Conditions in the agricultural and resource extraction sectors were mixed. Demand for bank loans generally was strong, but several districts reported slower activity in some loan categories, especially consumer loans and residential mortgages. 
Constraints on the availability of labor and other production inputs were apparent in many areas. Most districts reported tight supplies and upward wage pressure for various types of labor, both skilled and entry level. Despite faster wage growth for some workers, increases in the prices of final goods and services were limited overall, although the prices of transportation services and some industrial commodities rose noticeably. Consumer Spending 
Retail sales were strong in most areas and generally met or exceeded retailers' expectations for the period. Compared to a year earlier, growth in retail sales was in the upper

ii single-digit range in Boston, the mid-single digit range in Chicago, and 3 to 7 percent in New 
York. By product line, consumer electronics, appliances, and home furnishings posted the strongest sales increases. Further advances in e-commerce sales were reported in a few districts, although Kansas City noted that online sellers gained business at the expense of retailers in rural areas. Demand for automobiles and light trucks was solid on net; sales mostly were at or above high levels from a year earlier, with reports ofdouble-digit gains in the Minneapolis District. In contrast, several districts noted sluggish sales of apparel. Inventories generally were deemed appropriate for the prevailing pace of sales, although slow sales contributed to a buildup of apparel inventories in San Francisco and winter merchandise inventories in New York. Manufacturing 
Most districts reported a pickup in manufacturing activity in January and February. The gains were moderate in general, although Richmond's report indicated considerable strengthening. Cleveland noted strong growth in demand for industrial machinery. Sales of semiconductors and related high-tech equipment were strong in Dallas and San Francisco, and earlier tight supplies of semiconductors and flat-panel display monitors have eased. Demand for a variety of other manufactured products grew substantially, including metal products, electronics, furniture, chemicals, paper, and food. Demand for steel was especially strong, largely for use in the manufacture of motor vehicles and other consumer durable goods. Among less upbeat indicators, Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco noted cutbacks or ongoing weakness in aerospace manufacturing, and Chicago reported that the market for construction and agricultural equipment remained soft. In addition, Dallas reported that refineries in that district 
iii are being squeezed by high prices of crude oil and have reduced output; reports from that district 
also indicate that gasoline inventories are low heading into the spring and summer driving seasons. 
Nonfinancial Services 
Reports from the Boston, New York, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts indicated that activity of firms providing nonfinancial services to businesses and consumers grew briskly during the survey period. Temporary employment agencies were very busy, with Boston reporting revenue growth of 25 percent from a year earlier for these firms. Computer services firms expanded rapidly in several districts, with newly created internet firms reportedly spending large sums on advertising campaigns in the San Francisco District. Demand for transportation services was strong, but availability of trucking services was constrained in some areas by labor shortages. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Construction activity and demand for residential and nonresidential real estate remained at high levels, although cooling was evident in some markets. Demand for commercial space was strong in most areas, with low vacancy rates and rising rents even in areas where substantial new space has come on line. Reports from the Minneapolis District indicated that commercial construction values were up more than 20 percent in recent months compared with a year earlier. In contrast, Dallas reported a sharp increase in office subleasing and an ongoing decline in lease rates in that city; Atlanta noted slower nonresidential construction activity; and San Francisco reported that nonresidential markets have softened somewhat in two inland states in that district. 
iv Residential construction activity and sales ofnew homes remained strong in many areas, 
although several reports cited evidence of slowing compared with 1999. Recent levels of construction and sales activity were near historical highs in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, and they also have remained high in California, where home prices have been rising rapidly. However, signs of cooling in residential real estate markets have emerged in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts and in several states in the San Francisco District. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural producers faced mixed conditions overall, with solid demand for meat products offset by drought conditions and poor crop yields in some areas. San Francisco noted rising demand for beef, and Chicago reported that hog farmers benefited from a substantial increase in hog prices during the past year. By contrast, drought conditions have hit Texas farmers hard, producing poor conditions for wheat and oat crops and necessitating costly supplemental feeding and herd reduction among livestock suppliers. Dry weather also has harmed the winter wheat crop in the Kansas City District and is a concern for cattle ranchers in Arizona. 
Despite the recent sharp increase in the price of crude oil, conditions in the resource extraction industry were mixed. Oil drilling and extraction activity increased in several districts, but they were ""lackluster"" in Dallas, where companies have been choosing to pay down debt rather than risk expansion. In Minneapolis, mining of iron ore picked up further in response to strong demand, but gold mining remained weak. 
Financial Services and Credit 
Demand for bank loans was solid overall, although several districts reported softening in some categories. Lending activity was strong and expanded in most or all loan categories in Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco. However, Cleveland reported declining demand for consumer and commercial loans, Kansas City noted that slower real estate loan activity had held total loans down, and New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas indicated that consumer and residential mortgage lending has slowed. Several districts noted that a relative scarcity of deposits has kept margins thin and has spurred search for alternative sources of funds; however, no district reported liquidity problems. Credit quality and lending standards were stable in general, although New York and Kansas City reported tighter standards for some banks. Employment, Wages, and Prices 
Labor markets were very tight in most areas, and wage pressures increased for some worker groups, although most reports suggested moderate wage gains on net. Reports of 
recruitment obstacles were widespread, and some employers responded by recruiting among nontraditional worker groups (for example, senior citizens and teens), relying on increased 
overtime, and emphasizing employment perquisites and bonuses rather than increasing base wages. Very tight market conditions were reported for nurses in St. Louis and Minneapolis, restaurant and retail workers in Kansas City, and computer-savvy workers in many districts. Chicago reported a sharp increase in truckers' wages, and San Francisco and New York noted shortages and high turnover among truck drivers. In terms of general year-over-year changes, wage gains were reported to be 3 to 5 percent in St. Louis and 2 to 4 percent in Minneapolis. 
vi Kansas City reported that wage pressures have eased compared to the latter half of 1999. 
However, New York reported wage increases of 10 to 15 percent in jobs being filled by year 2000 college graduates recruited through employment agencies there, and Philadelphia reported faster wage gains overall. 
Prices of some industrial commodities rose noticeably, especially for energy and petroleum-related products. Rising wages and fuel costs have raised prices and reduced profit margins for providers of transportation services, especially trucking. Other commodity inputs and raw materials with noticeable price increases included steel, primary metals, building materials, and computer memory chips in the industrial sector and chemicals and fertilizers in the agricultural sector. However, increases in the prices of final goods and services reportedly were limited overall.",1,0
2000-02-29,"Reports from most Federal Reserve Districts indicated strong economic growth in December and early January. Economic activity was described as strong in most Federal Reserve Districts. Growth was characterized as solid in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts, and as moderate in the Districts of Atlanta and Chicago. 
Consumer spending growth was rapid during the holiday shopping period, and many retailers expect the high level of activity to continue into early 2000. Manufacturing continued to expand in nearly every District and was broadly based across industries. Exceptions to this were in the food, apparel, agricultural equipment, and some construction-based industries. Residential real estate construction was mixed across regions, with the northeastern states experiencing an inventory shortage, the southern and midwestern states a slowdown, and the western states an expansion. Commercial construction activity varied across the country. Bank lending was mixed, with a decrease in mortgage lending that was often offset by increases in consumer and commercial lending. 
Labor markets remained tight in all Districts. However, the tight labor markets did not seem to be matched with large wage increases. Most consumer prices appear to be holding steady in much ofthe country, although a few Districts reported moderate increases. Producer prices also appear to be flat, with the exception of rising petroleum prices. 
The century rollover caused little or no disruption to commercial or production activity, and consumer stockbuilding was limited to increases in items such as bottled 
water and batteries. Few future disruptions are anticipated, and few problems concerning Y2K-related inventories are expected. 
Consumer Spending 
Retail sales attained or exceeded expectations for the month ofDecember in all Districts except the St. Louis District, where sales increases of 4 to 5 percent were considered to be below expectations. Sales were especially high throughout the nation in 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected before January 12, 2000. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a representation of the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
electronics, toys, and jewelry. Several Districts reported lower-than-average sales of apparel due to unseasonably warm weather. 
All regions reported large gains in e-commerce. The growth in Internet sales had a minimal reported effect on more traditional shopping, with retailers only in the St. Louis District reporting negative effects. Some retailers in the San Francisco District mentioned that e-commerce sales were concentrated in the beginning of the holiday period and that the sales stimulated competition in retail markets. Many Districts reported an increase in the intent to invest in e-commerce as a result of the high sales. 
Auto sales were high thoughout the country, especially for sport utility vehicles and light trucks. 
Manufacturing 
Industrial activity was generally strong throughout the country. The Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts all reported robust growth in manufacturing. Philadelphia reported new orders just holding steady, although shipments were rising. Richmond reported a moderate increase in new orders. New York and Atlanta reported steady activity, and Kansas City reported a drop- off from previous high levels. 
The advance in manufacturing activity has been broadly based. The Boston District reported strong growth in semiconductors and paper, and Philadelphia in lumber, plastics, and metal products; Cleveland reported export-driven growth in heavy machinery and domestic-driven growth in electronic building components and steel; Richmond reported increased shipments in machinery, metal products, and electronics, and Atlanta in chemicals, paper, drugs, and high-tech products; Chicago indicated strength in autos and steel, St. Louis in high-tech products, paper, wood products, and electrical equipment, and Dallas in construction materials (except for cement and concrete); finally, San Francisco reported strength in high-tech products, drugs, and chemicals, driven by both domestic and export demand. 
However, some industries are contracting in some regions. Notably, demand for agricultural equipment (in the Chicago District), apparel (in the Atlanta District), textiles, 
foods, and tobacco (in the Richmond District), and cement and concrete (in the Dallas District) were all reported to be soft. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Residential construction was mixed across Districts. The Boston and New York Districts both reported low inventories of homes, with new construction limited by 
shortages of construction labor and buildable land. The Philadelphia District, however, reported a decline in demand for construction labor. The Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts all reported slower residential construction 
activity. On the other hand, the Kansas City District reported steady residential construction, and the Dallas and San Francisco Districts (where home inventories are tight) both reported high levels of residential construction activity. Where residential construction has slowed, higher interest rates were often mentioned as the reason. 
Commercial construction also varied across Districts and did not always follow the residential construction patterns. In the Cleveland District, commercial construction is growing. In the Richmond District, increased city vacancy rates reportedly led to reduced construction activity. Commercial construction is booming in Florida, while it is slowing in other parts of the Atlanta District. In the Chicago District, there is a slight slowing, although vacancy rates are low. In the St. Louis District, construction is steady; in the Minneapolis District, it is high, although vacancy rates are rising. In both the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, commercial construction is strong. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Low prices for cereal crops continued to affect farm incomes, although farmers in Missouri mentioned that foreign demand for these products was picking up. The winter wheat crop generally looks good in much of the country, while agriculture in Texas is suffering from a drought. Hog producers are reducing their herds in response to low pork prices. The Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all reported that cattle producers are doing well, with a combination of high beef prices and low feed prices. 
Increases in oil prices have led to both the activation and building of new rigs in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. The Dallas District reported new drilling for natural gas. Increases in steel production have stimulated greatly increased iron ore production in the Minneapolis District. Financial Services and Credit 
Bank lending was mixed across Districts. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco reported strong growth in loans. St. Louis and 
Dallas reported flat lending, and New York indicated a seasonal softness. Even those Districts reporting growth in total loans often indicated a softness in mortgages, 
particularly in refinancings, due to higher rates. These were more than offset by strength in consumer and commercial loans. 
The New York and Cleveland Districts reported that delinquencies were down and credit standards were higher, while Richmond reported less stringent loan requirements. Standards were reported unchanged in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Employment 
All Districts reported tight labor markets. Atlanta reported that Florida help- wanted ads are at record volume. Specific categories of employees in especially short 
supply included office managers (New York and Cleveland), high-tech workers (Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco), nurses (Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City), truckers (Kansas City and Dallas), and pharmaceutical workers (Minneapolis and San Francisco). Increasing numbers of construction workers are looking for work due to soft demand in Philadelphia and Minneapolis while they are sought by employers in Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis. 
Wages and Prices 
Wage increases varied throughout the country. The Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts reported stable wages or moderate increases that are consistent with productivity gains. Richmond reported moderately strong increases in the retail and service industries. Dallas reported wage increases for truckers and lawyers. Minneapolis said that an increasing fraction of firms was planning wage growth of at least 4 percent. Many Districts indicated that wage pressure is being met by non-wage benefits such as stock options, bonuses, and increased health benefit coverage. 
Most Districts reported steady consumer prices. Businesses cited competition and increased productivity as reasons for not increasing their output prices, even in the face of increases in the prices of some raw materials. There were some exceptions, however. The Minneapolis District noted signs of accelerating inflation, including reports that many consumers expect the Consumer Price Index to rise by more than 3 percent and that a rising percentage of firms plan price increases. Philadelphia reported planned increases during the year 2000, Richmond reported moderate price increases in both the retail and 
service sectors, Boston noted rising hotel prices, and New York reported sharp increases in real estate prices in the New York City metropolitan area. 
Input prices were usually reported as being flat with the exception of energy inputs, which are rising in price. Several Districts reported anticipated steel price increases. San Francisco reported raw materials price increases in logs. San Francisco also reported steady declines in the prices of telecommunication and Internet services. The Effect of Y2K 
There was little impact of the Y2K computer bug. Most Districts reported only minor disruptions, such as an increase in consumer demand for items like bottled water 
and batteries. Even this demand was described as such a small portion of the overall business that inventory disruptions were minor. There was little or no producer 
stockpiling in anticipation of the event. Banks indicated that Y2K caused no liquidity problems and that less cash was withdrawn than anticipated. 
The Richmond District reported a fall in tourism that may be Y2K related. The Dallas District reported some uncertainty in cargo demand due to possible Y2K 
stockpiling and some unemployment of information technologists. This was unusual in that several Districts reported more information technology employment opportunities for 
expected increased computer-related business now that Y2K efforts have largely passed. The Richmond District reported temporary employment agencies are having no problems placing temporary computer workers, who have been released from Y2K projects, into new jobs.",0,0
1999-11-30,"Most districts continue to report strong economic growth but some slowing is noted. Manufacturing activity continues to advance in almost all districts and for most industries. Although four districts report some slowing in consumer outlays, spending generally remains strong and most retailers are expecting increases in holiday sales from last year. Real estate and construction are still robust in most districts, though there are signs of some moderation in activity. The mining and energy industries are showing signs of recharging. Overall loan demand remains brisk, although a softening is noted by some districts in consumer loan demand. Labor markets remain tight across the country, with numerous districts reporting continued difficulty in finding and retaining qualified workers. Many districts report a pickup in wage increases, but overall prices remain stable with some notable exceptions: Increases in prices were noted for some manufacturing inputs, health care, memory chips and construction materials. By contrast, low prices continue to weigh heavily on some important segments of the agricultural sector. 
Consumer Spending 
Many districts report continued steady to strong retail spending, while the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City and New York districts mention weakening sales. The Minneapolis and San Francisco districts report sizable increases in sales; in the Philadelphia district, several stores experienced double-digit increases over last year. Sales growth in the Boston district is generally exceeding retailers' expectations. But retailers in the Kansas City district report a decline in sales, following flat activity in the three previous surveys. Most districts note that retailers expect strong consumer demand as the holiday season approaches. Auto dealers report solid sales in the

System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Dallas, Kansas City and Philadelphia districts, with weakening demand indicated in the Chicago district. In the Cleveland district, auto sales slowed in October after a record summer. Some dealers continue to have short inventories of some popular models. Fall tourism is steady compared to a year earlier in the Minneapolis district. Hurricane Floyd depressed tourism at coastal destinations in the Richmond district, but inland mountain resorts report gains. Manufacturing 
Nearly all districts report that manufacturing activity is growing. The Boston district reports most suppliers to the semiconductor, telecommunications, biotech and construction 
industries are experiencing double-digit increases in business. Several manufacturers of industrial products and chemicals in the Philadelphia district note increases in orders from 
customers in Asia. The Richmond district reports that shipments and capacity utilization levels are increasing; production was particularly strong in printing and publishing. Shipyards in Louisiana are operating at full capacity, according to the Atlanta district. The Chicago district reports that automobile production was steady at very high levels in recent months. Strong growth in sales of plastics and building materials is reported by the St. Louis district. The Dallas district reports a slight increase in manufacturing activity. The San Francisco district reports expansions in petrochemical production, paper processing, steel manufacturing and high- technology equipment manufacturing. 
Kansas City is the only district reporting a slowing in overall manufacturing activity. In addition, the Boston district notes that production of industrial machinery and machine tools remains below year-earlier levels. 
Moreover, several districts report selected price increases: health care costs (Atlanta, Chicago and Minneapolis), memory chips (Dallas), paper (Minneapolis) and construction materials (Atlanta and Minneapolis). In contrast, the Dallas district reports the prices of lumber and wood products and cement have declined recently. 
Real Estate and Construction 
Real estate and construction remain robust in most districts, though indications of some slowing have surfaced recently. Residential real estate activity is at high levels in the Richmond and San Francisco districts, although the pace of growth is slowing. In the Boston, Chicago and Kansas City districts recent interest rate increases have curbed home sales. Existing home sales rose just 1 percent in September in New York State, but prices increased 6 percent from a year earlier. In the Kansas City district building activity improved following several months of decline, but was flat compared with a year ago. Housing units authorized are above year-earlier levels in the Minneapolis and St. Louis districts. 
The commercial real estate markets are considered tight in several districts and commercial construction is increasing. The Chicago, New York and Richmond districts report low office vacancy rates. The pace of construction is slightly ahead of a year ago in the Atlanta district, but the level of activity was uneven across the district. 
Most districts report that residential and nonresidential construction is constrained by labor shortages and higher prices on some construction supplies. The St. Louis district notes that 
shortages of workers and certain materials will continue to delay some projects. 
Banking and Finance 
Most districts report increases in overall loan demand, although four districts indicate some easing in the demand for consumer loans. The Cleveland, New York, Richmond and 
Chicago districts report a softening in consumer loan demand. Only the New York district experienced weakness in overall loan demand. Commercial lending activity increased in the 
Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago and Kansas City districts. The Richmond district reports that commercial bank lending is driven by continued business expansion and, in some cases, the anticipation of higher interest rates. Consumer lending has strengthened in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City districts. Credit quality is good in the Atlanta district, and bankruptcies continue to gradually decline. The San Francisco district reports continued solid credit quality, while in the St. Louis district many bankers are becoming increasingly concerned about delinquency rates and have upped their loan loss reserves accordingly. The New York district reports tighter credit standards for all categories of loans. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Most of the country is having a good harvest. The Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts all report good harvest conditions for their crops. Record soybean and sugar beet crops are projected for some states. Drought has reduced yields in the Dallas, Richmond and St. Louis districts, but hurricanes brought much-needed rain to most areas of the East Coast and too much rain in some areas. The San Francisco district reports mixed agricultural conditions, with good conditions for fruits and rice, and poor conditions for vegetable and grain producers. Farm income, however, remains depressed as dismal agricultural prices are offsetting the bumper crop. 
Conditions for dairy producers remain strong, report the Cleveland and San Francisco districts. Meanwhile, cattle and swine herds have benefited from low feed prices. The Kansas City and San Francisco districts report favorable conditions for cattle ranchers; however, the Chicago district reports a sharp decline in the size of the swine breeding herd. The Dallas district 
reports most pastures had limited forage for livestock, and supplemental feeding and herd reduction continued in most areas. 
Oil exploration is on the rise, with oil rig counts in the Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts higher than early summer levels. In addition, the Minneapolis district reports several iron ore mines restarting taconite production",1,1
1999-10-31,"All district economies continue to exhibit overall strength, with most experiencing moderate-to-brisk rates of growth. Retail sales are generally up in most districts, with back-to-school sales meeting or exceeding retailers' expectations in many cases. Vehicle sales remain robust, although some dealers are unable to meet demand for popular models. Industrial activity is on the rise in most parts of the country, with orders and production both up. In some cases, resurgent Asian demand is contributing to 
this rise in activity. Although commentary from most district reports continues to highlight widespread labor shortages, several districts have noted a slackening in the 
demand for labor. There are few reports of acceleration in nominal wages and salaries, although some districts note a substantial upswing in the cost of health-care benefits. While price pressures at the consumer level remain mostly calm, numerous districts report significant increases in some materials prices. Home sales and construction remain elevated, but many districts have begun noticing a slowdown. Commercial real estate markets are tight in many districts. Loan demand, except for residential real estate loans, is well-sustained across districts. Credit quality and standards remain unchanged, for the most part. The recent drought has worsened crop and livestock conditions in the East and parts of the Midwest. 
Consumer Spending 
Most districts report that retail sales are up from their year-ago levels. Back-to- school sales, in particular, either met or exceeded expectations in the Boston, Chicago,

i 
ii Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis districts. The Atlanta district, however, reports 
declining sales from a year earlier, while the Kansas City and New York districts indicate mixed or flat sales. The San Francisco district notes that back-to-school shoppers remained cautious this year, searching for bargains and delaying purchases until Labor Day sales arrived. Apparel sales have been brisk in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia and St. Louis districts, but not in the Chicago district or parts of the New York district. The Minneapolis district reports strong sales of high-end electronics in Minnesota. Hot weather hampered sales of lawn-and-garden goods in the New York, Richmond and St. Louis districts. Most districts report that retailers' inventories are at desired levels, although some contacts in the Cleveland district note that their inventories are a bit lean. On the other hand, some contacts in the Kansas City district believe that their inventories are too high. 
Auto sales, particularly of new vehicles, remain strong in most parts of the country. The Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City and St. Louis districts note substantial gains in auto sales, while the Richmond district reports a weakening of sales, due mostly to hot weather. Consequently, dealer inventories in the Richmond district are up. On the other hand, some dealers in the Cleveland, Philadelphia and St. Louis districts are still having difficulty stocking enough popular models to meet demand; inventories are not a concern for dealers in the Kansas City district. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity appears to have accelerated in almost every district. The Richmond district, however, reports some moderation in the rate of growth. The Kansas City district notes that its contacts are experiencing their highest capacity- 
iii utilization levels in a year. The Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis districts report solid 
demand for steel and other metal products, particularly from the auto industry. The Boston, Dallas and Minneapolis districts note strong demand for semiconductors and 
computer components. The San Francisco district reports that improving demand from East Asia has boosted orders in the electrical equipment, wood, chemicals, processed 
food and industrial machinery industries. Industrial machinery production also accelerated in the Atlanta district and rebounded in the Boston district. 
The production of apparel appears to be down across the board. Orders for heavy trucks and construction and agricultural equipment have weakened at Chicago district firms. While the tobacco industry in the St. Louis district is experiencing a slackening in domestic demand, tobacco shipments from Richmond district firms remain strong. The commercial aerospace industries in the Atlanta and San Francisco districts report weakening demand. 
The Philadelphia district notes that manufacturing inventories are at desired levels. The Atlanta district comments that a maker of batteries and flashlights expects 
heavy demand around year-end and, therefore, plans to increase its inventory accordingly. Cleveland district contacts report no inventory stockpiling, while San Francisco district contacts have seen their excess inventories drawn down recently. Contacts in the Kansas City district plan to trim inventories soon because they are getting too high. 
Labor Markets 
For the most part, the theme of this report is unchanged from recent reports: The demand for labor continues to outstrip the readily available supply of labor in most 
iv areas. The Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Philadelphia districts note that tight labor 
markets remain the norm. Retailers inthe Boston, Kansas City and New York districts reported that they cannot find enough staff to fill vacancies. Manufacturers inthe 
Boston and St. Louis districts express the same concern. A couple of districts continue to highlight the construction industry's ongoing labor supply problems, although the number of these reports has lessened somewhat. Demand at temporary employment agencies remains on the upswing inthe Boston, Dallas and Richmond districts, while remaining steady in the Cleveland district. In contrast, a few districts have noticed a slight easing of labor market tightness. The Richmond district reports that manufacturing employment and hours have grown at a slower pace than they had previously. The completion of Y2K-compliance work insome industries inthe Dallas district has reduced the demand for technology workers, while weakness inthe San Francisco district's commercial aircraft industry has led to layoffs at major producers 
and suppliers. 
Wages and Prices 
On balance, wage and salary increases remain within the range noted in previous reports. Wages at manufacturing firms are reportedly picking up in the Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Richmond districts, remaining steady inthe St. Louis district, and easing somewhat inthe Kansas City district. The Boston and Minneapolis districts note that wages at retail establishments are growing between 3 and 5 percent; intheKansasCitydistrict,retailersreportfeelingincreasedwagepressures. The Cleveland and Dallas districts note accelerating wage growth, particularly among some classes of temporary workers. The Atlanta and Minneapolis districts report sharp 
V 
increases in the employer costs of health-care benefits. The majority of district reports indicate that price pressures at the retail level are 
not readily apparent. Where they are apparent, they are categorized as temperate. Prices pressures at the wholesale level appear to be somewhat greater. The Chicago, Cleveland and Richmond districts report price increases at manufacturers, with steel makers in the Cleveland district announcing hikes of between 5 and 7 percent. The Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Richmond districts all report that higher raw materials costs are evident. The Dallas district adds that construction costs (both labor and materials) are up between 5 and 8 percent so far this year. The San Francisco district, however, notes that prices for manufacturers' inputs have been ""stable or declining."" Real Estate and Construction 
The consensus across most districts is that while home sales remain elevated, some slowing has recently become apparent in both sales and construction. Home sales have already weakened somewhat in the Atlanta and Chicago districts. The New York district, however, reports that real estate activity in New Jersey is increasingly being hampered by supply constraints-low inventories of existing homes and a shortage of usable land for new construction. The San Francisco district notes that real estate markets in Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington's Puget Sound region are robust; elsewhere in the district, they have slowed. Just about all districts cite higher mortgage rates as a primary reason for the recent slowing. Other reasons include rising building costs and market saturation. Many districts are still reporting labor and/or material shortages, which are delaying construction. The 
vi 
Richmond district, however, notes that fewer complaints about labor or material shortages were received, perhaps signaling an easing in the pace of residential construction. Still, it seems that numbers of sales and new construction permits/starts in most districts are ahead of year-ago levels. 
Commercial real estate markets are tight in the Boston and Philadelphia districts, although real estate agents in the Philadelphia district believe that demand there may be peaking. The Cleveland district reports that nonresidential market conditions remain at a high level. Speculative nonresidential building is up in the St. Louis district. Apartment construction is strong in parts of South Dakota because of low vacancy rates. Banking and Finance 
Despite a drop in demand for mortgage and home-refinance loans, lending activity remains relatively strong. Only the Philadelphia and St. Louis districts report weaker overall loan demand. The strength of business lending varies by district, with only the Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts citing growth in the commercial-and-industrial loan category. Consumer lending has strengthened further in the Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City districts, has weakened in the Philadelphia and St. Louis districts, and has remained unchanged in the Richmond district. The Dallas and Philadelphia districts add that residential real estate lending remains healthy. The Cleveland and St. Louis districts report that competition for deposits is strong, while banks in the Dallas district report steady loan growth. Banks in the Kansas City and New York districts have recently tightened credit standards; banks in other districts report no change in standards. Outside of a concern about agricultural 
vii loan performance, credit quality remains good. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Drought conditions in much of the East and parts of the Midwest have taken their toll on both crops and livestock. The Chicago, Cleveland, Richmond and St. Louis districts all indicate that their corn and soybean crops are in poor-to-fair condition. The Cleveland district notes that the tobacco crop is also suffering. The rice and cotton crops in the St. Louis district are in good condition, though. The San Francisco district reports that unseasonable weather has lowered the quality and yield of many of its grains, fruits and vegetables. Incontrast, the Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts report favorable agricultural conditions, with their corn and soybean crops in good-to-excellent condition and with above-average yields expected. 
Livestock in the Cleveland, Dallas and Richmond districts are in poor-to-fair condition. Many farmers in the Cleveland and Richmond districts have begun feeding 
hay to their herds because of poor pasture conditions. Some farmers in the Cleveland district have even started paring down the sizes of herds. In the Kansas City district, 
however, low feed costs, stronger cattle prices and increasing profits are leading to a rebuilding of herds. 
Strong demand for natural gas has increased prices and drilling activity in the Dallas and Kansas City districts. With the price of oil also on the rise, the number of 
rigs on-line in the Kansas City district has been rising. In the Minneapolis district, though, the rig count is below year-ago levels.",1,1
1999-08-31,"District reports indicate continued strength in economic activity, though there are widespread reports of supply constraints. Retail sales, which had been robust in the second quarter, decelerated somewhat in July, in some cases due to low inventories of clearance merchandise. Manufacturing activity continues to expand in most parts of the country, though a few districts indicate some softening. Performance has varied substantially by industry: electronics, heavy trucks and construction materials continue to exhibit strength, while textiles and metals remain weak. Residential construction and housing markets remain strong in most districts, though in some areas shortages of materials, labor, and available land have constrained home construction, delayed projects and boosted costs. Commercial real estate markets remain tight in most districts; building is mixed but generally strong. Tourism has generally been strong, especially in the Middle and South Atlantic seaboard regions. 
Loan demand is steady or rising in most districts. Although there has been some decline in residential mortgage lending, and especially refinancing activity, demand for commercial and industrial loans, as well as consumer (largely auto) loans, continues to grow briskly. Expectations of large Midwest harvests have depressed grain prices, but drought conditions are hurting crops in the eastern part of the country. The energy sector has shown some signs of improvement in recent weeks, as oil prices have continued to climb, but the level of drilling activity remains sluggish and lower than a year ago.

contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
Widespread labor shortages persist in virtually every district, but there have been only scattered reports of an actual acceleration in wages. Final prices of goods and services remain 
relatively stable for the most part. There are some reports of accelerating prices-largely related to home construction-but there is no evidence of any broad-based pickup in consumer price 
inflation. 
Consumer Spending 
July retail sales were characterized as strong in most districts, but the pace of growth appears to have eased since the last report. While sales continue to run higher than a year ago in all districts, activity has slowed somewhat in New York and Dallas-partly due to low clearance inventories-and has held steady in Kansas City. Overall, retail inventories are generally at desired levels. However, lean stocks of summer merchandise, most notably air conditioners, are reported in New York and Philadelphia. Contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco express optimism that consumer spending will continue to be strong in the months ahead. 
Automobile sales continue at high levels in most parts of the country. In July, robust vehicle sales are reported in Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Dealers in Cleveland report low inventories, with certain models sold out. However, auto dealers in Philadelphia and Chicago say that sales slowed, following very brisk activity in June. 
Manufacturing 
Overall, manufacturing activity has been expanding in most districts, though Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City report some slowing. Manufacturing-sector performance varied 
iii 
considerably by industry. Output of industrial equipment and home-construction materials has been expanding briskly across most of the country, though there are scattered indications that growth is being limited by shortages of raw materials and labor. Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco report strong demand for electronic (computer/telecommunications) equipment; Cleveland and Chicago indicate strong orders for heavy trucks. There are also reports of strength in medical equipment (Boston), furniture (Richmond), and chemicals (Dallas). 
Weak or declining activity is reported in metals industries in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco, and in the textile industry in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta. Other reports of weakness come from makers of machine tools in Boston and San Francisco, farm equipment in Cleveland and Chicago, and commercial aircraft in St. Louis and San Francisco. Manufacturers in the west-Dallas and San Francisco-report some pickup in exports to Asia; producers in the Boston district see only scattered signs of improvement in Asian markets. 
Real Estate & Construction 
Housing activity continues at a vigorous pace in most districts, though supply constraints are limiting growth in many areas. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis indicate persistent strength in residential real estate. Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco report that housing activity slowed somewhat in July. New York and Richmond indicate that the recent rise in mortgage rates has not adversely affected the housing market and may have prompted some buyers to act. 
Shortages of materials, labor and land are hindering construction and delaying projects in some areas. Land shortages are cited in New York and Atlanta. Labor shortages are indicated in New York, St. Louis, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco--mainly for skilled tradespeople, such 
as carpenters, framers, and masons. Many districts also report problems in obtaining key construction materials, most notably drywall, insulation and bricks. Home sales in Boston, New York and Atlanta are being limited by construction bottlenecks, combined with low inventories of existing homes. 
Commercial real estate markets remain tight in most areas. St. Louis indicates a pickup in activity, while New York, Richmond, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco report that conditions are steady and strong. However, some contacts in the Cleveland and Dallas districts, though pleased with current conditions, express concern that vacancy rates have begun to rise. 
Tourism and Services 
Tourism has generally been very strong. Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta note that summer resort areas are having an exceptionally good year; New York reports that hotel business has held steady at a high level through the first half of 1999. Boston and San Francisco cite a decline in international visitors from Asia and (in Boston's case) from Canada. Districts reporting on other non-retail service industries-Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco-indicate that they are in good shape. 
Financial Services 
Banks in most districts report that overall loan demand is steady or growing, despite a dip in demand for residential mortgages. Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City indicate increasing loan demand, while New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Dallas report that demand is flat, on balance. By contrast, St. Louis district banks report declining loan demand, though this is largely attributed to a loss of share by banks in the mortgage market. Strong growth in 
commercial and industrial loans is reported from Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Consumer lending is reported to be strengthening in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City and Dallas districts but flat in New York and Cleveland. However, residential mortgage lending is generally weaker in Richmond and Dallas, as well as St. Louis. Declines in refinancing activity are reported in New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City. 
Credit quality appears to have improved, on balance, since the last report. New York, Cleveland and Chicago note an improvement in overall credit quality, while Atlanta and San 
Francisco indicate little or no change. Lending standards are mostly unchanged, though New York and Cleveland report some tightening in standards. 
Agriculture, Mining, Natural Resources 
Hot and dry weather in the eastern part of the country has caused some crop damage, but crops are generally reported to be in good shape in the interior regions. Philadelphia and Richmond report that drought conditions are severely hurting this year's corn and soybean crops. Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis report that the corn and soybean crops are generally in good condition, but pasture conditions are poor. Expectations of a large harvest have depressed prices, hurting farmers' incomes. In Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco, wet weather has hindered output of some crops. 
The recent rise in oil prices has boosted activity in the Kansas City, Dallas, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts, though rig counts are still said to be well below last year's levels. Dallas reports that most of the increase in activity is in small, low-risk projects, while major projects (off-shore and foreign drilling) continue to trend down. 
Labor Markets, Wages, Inflation 
Virtually all districts report widespread labor shortages, but most indicate that overall wage growth remains subdued. There are severe shortages of skilled construction workers- particularly carpenters and brick masons-in most districts. Excess demand for computer and information technology workers is reported in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas; however, Chicago notes some slackening in demand for Y2K staff. Retailers, including restaurants, report labor shortages in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and Kansas City. San Francisco notes a shortage of seasonal agricultural workers. 
Despite the labor shortages, none of the districts reports evidence of any broad-based acceleration in wages. Still, there were scattered reports of accelerating or rapidly-rising wages-in biotechnology (Boston), construction (New York, Kansas City, San Francisco), retail (Philadelphia, Richmond), health-care (Atlanta), and transportation (Minneapolis). In addition, strong wage increases for office workers with technical skills are reported in Chicago and Kansas City. Aside from boosting wages, businesses are dealing with labor shortages in various ways: retailers in Boston are expanding performance-based compensation; businesses in Cleveland are providing job security commitments; truckers in St. Louis and builders in Kansas City are increasingly recruiting internationally and (in the latter case) using signing bonuses more than in the past. 
Consumer prices remain relatively stable, despite some apparent intensification in input price pressures. Manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago indicate a general increase in input costs, although those in Boston report flat to declining input prices. A number of districts indicate an acceleration in prices for certain materials-particularly construction materials such as drywall, lumber, bricks and insulation materials, as well as energy and 
vii 
transportation costs. Also, steel and paper prices, though low, have turned up recently. Agriculture and livestock prices, however, remain weak and are mostly down from a year ago. 
There is no evidence of any broad-based acceleration in prices of finished goods and services. Retailers in Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco 
report stable prices, while those in Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas indicate modest increases. Hotel room rates have risen noticeably in Boston but have leveled off in New York following sharp rises last year.",1,1
1999-07-31,"District reports indicate that the U.S. economy remains strong, with gains in activity widespread. Retail activity in most districts has shown little sign of slowing, and consumers remain upbeat about the economy. Home furnishings and motor vehicles sold particularly well in April and May. Manufacturing activity continues to improve in most areas from the sluggish conditions of the past year and a half. Production of such items as electronics, machinery, heavy trucks, and construction equipment has been especially strong, although some sectors, such as steel and apparel, continue to face stiff competition from foreign producers. Construction continues to grow at a brisk pace throughout the nation, spurred by strong home sales in most parts of the country. Shortages of labor and materials, however, have resulted in higher building costs in some districts. Lending activity remains strong in most districts despite a slowdown in refinancings due to slightly higher mortgage rates. In the agricultural economy, growing and planting conditions have been mixed. There is little optimism about farm incomes in 1999, as most agricultural commodity prices remain low. Energy activity in most regions has been slow to react to the recent increases in oil prices, although expectations of a solid recovery are high. 
Labor markets remain very tight in almost all districts, with increased reports of upward pressure on wages in many parts of the country. There have been some reports that labor supply constraints are impeding employment growth in many sectors. Prices, however, with the exception of several construction materials, remain well behaved.

Reserve officials. 
Consumer Spending 
The strong retail activity in most districts earlier in the year showed almost no signs of easing in April and May, as consumers remained upbeat about the economy. The only district 
reporting weaker activity was Kansas City, where sales have edged down but are still above year- ago levels. Retailers in the Cleveland district report especially strong sales numbers for May, particularly for specialty apparel items. The hottest selling products in most districts have been home furnishings and appliances, in part reflecting continuing strength in home sales and 
housing construction. Stores in metropolitan areas of the Dallas and Minneapolis districts posted vigorous sales, but rural merchants in these districts continue to suffer as a result of a weak agricultural sector. Airline and cruise bookings in the Atlanta district remain strong even as prices have edged up, and advance summer bookings for south Florida resorts are higher than a year ago. Labor shortages are a major concern for many retailers, especially for entry-level workers and sales associates. In the Cleveland district, virtually all companies operating amusement parks have been severely understaffed, with some having to cut back operations as a result. Stores in several districts increased their inventories in May in anticipation of robust sales throughout the summer. 
Automobile sales increased in most districts in April and May due largely to the continued popularity of light trucks and sports-utility vehicles. Inventories of new trucks have been tight in most places, particularly in the St. Louis and Kansas City districts. Auto dealers in the Chicago district have been able to push through modest price increases. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity in most districts has continued to improve from the sluggish 
iii 
conditions experienced in the recent past. Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas, however, report mixed results, and New York notes some slowing in factory activity. Strong new orders, production, 
and shipments were reported for many manufacturing products, such as heavy trucks, electronic equipment, machinery, and food and biotechnology products. Brisk demand for construction equipment and building materials has continued across the nation, as construction activity remains strong. Similarly, a strong housing market continues to fuel the demand for appliances. San Francisco reports that increased demand from East Asia has helped paper and pulp processors in the Pacific Northwest. Some sectors continue to report strong foreign competition, however. For example, activity at steel mills remains weak and many apparel producers continue to struggle with competition from cheap imports. 
Manufacturers in several regions have expressed concern about labor availability and continue to report difficulties in hiring skilled technical workers, especially in the information technology area. As a result of a shortage of qualified workers, not all of the increase in demand for manufactured goods in the St. Louis district has been met. Additionally, labor costs have become a major concern for most contacts in that district. On a positive note, many districts continue to report healthy productivity gains, with Richmond noting that several manufacturers are experiencing record productivity, in part because of increased capital spending. 
Construction and Real Estate 
Construction activity and real estate markets remain robust in most parts ofthe country following an exceptional first quarter. Only New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City appear to be experiencing slightly weaker building activity, but in all three districts activity is still well above year-ago levels. Sales of new and existing homes remain very strong in Chicago and St. Louis, 
iv 
with a shortage of available houses leading to rising prices and quick sales. Construction in the Kansas City district is expected to pick up considerably over the summer months as Kansas and Oklahoma rebuild from tornadoes that destroyed or severely damaged more than 10,000 homes and businesses. 
Commercial real estate markets have improved in most districts. Demand for office space in downtown Boston continues to increase. Retail, office, and warehouse leasing commitments in the Richmond district have been stronger as well, especially in Virginia and the Carolinas. In Chicago, the retail segment has been particularly vibrant. 
Builders in most districts continue to complain of substantial shortages of labor, especially for framers. Several construction materials, particularly sheetrock, also remain in short supply. The shortages have created rising construction costs, and project schedules in some districts have been affected, but builders in general remain optimistic about the future. 
Banking and Finance 
Demand for loans has remained strong in most districts, although some weakness in commercial loan demand has been seen in New York and Atlanta. Several districts report strong competition among banks for high-quality commercial customers, with some indication in Chicago that this may be affecting lending standards. In most districts, however, lending standards remain generally unchanged. 
Higher mortgage rates appear to have slowed refinancing activity across the country, but real estate loan origination and consumer lending remain strong overall. Chicago, New York, 
and Philadelphia report some signs of weakness on the consumer side, however. Loan delinquency rates have shown some improvement across districts. 
Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources 
In the agricultural sector, growing and planting conditions have been mixed across districts. Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas report planting has been generally at or ahead of schedule. Dry conditions have hindered planting and crop development in some areas of the Richmond and Cleveland districts, however, while Minneapolis has seen some problems caused by wet fields. 
There is little optimism about farm incomes across districts, as commodity prices remain low. As a result, agricultural credit markets are somewhat stressed, with Minneapolis reporting increases in farm liquidations and bankruptcies and Chicago reporting a general slowing in agricultural loan repayments. 
Oil exploration has been slow to react to price increases in most areas, but expectations of a solid recovery are high if the price increase is sustained. Some increases in activity have been seen recently, such as in the Kansas City district, but rig counts remain well below year-ago levels. 
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices 
Labor markets were extremely tight last month in almost all districts, with no signs of easing in the foreseeable future. Despite the summer influx of student workers, temporary employment firms in many districts have been unable to fill all their job openings. Employers in Cleveland are hiring temporary workers in hopes they will become permanent employees after a short trial period. Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis note that severe labor supply constraints are hampering employment growth in many sectors. 
Although labor shortages are reported in almost all sectors, some skilled workers have been in especially short supply and many employers have broadened their searches from local to regional and national levels. Information technology workers, in particular, are very difficult to find. As an employment agent in Northern Virginia put it: ""Anyone that can operate a personal computer can get a job."" Skilled tradesmen in the construction sector are also extremely scarce, especially in urban areas where the building boom continues. The Minneapolis district reports that builders in Duluth imported 200 trade workers due to the lack of available local workers. 
Persistently tight labor markets have resulted in many reports of increased wage pressures, especially for some specific industries and skilled occupations. Chicago, St. Louis, and Richmond report upward wage pressures in almost all sectors, while other districts report 
more scattered wage increases. For example, retailers in the Boston district report a recent increase in the use of higher wages as a recruiting tool, while a large retail chain in New York notes increased wage pressures primarily for entry-level positions. In Dallas, wages have risen for truckers, secretaries, legal assistants, and workers with technical skills. Similarly, wage changes in San Francisco have been generally limited, but increases were noted for some types of workers. Cleveland and Philadelphia report that wage pressures have generally been held in check, but rising benefits costs have become more common. The Kansas City district is an exception, as wage pressures there appear to have eased somewhat from previous surveys. 
Many districts suggest that employers have continued to be creative in finding and recruiting additional labor. Employers in the Atlanta district, for example, appear to be using 
more bonuses and incentives as part of total labor compensation, and many companies are using more part-time workers and consultants as well as allowing employees to work at home. Some firms in the Boston district are avoiding higher labor costs for new hires by outsourcing and 
changing work assignments internally. Prices remain generally subdued, but many districts report pockets of higher prices for 
some specific sectors and goods. At the retail level, price increases have been marginal and infrequent. Retailers indicate that stiff competition continues to restrain price increases. Dallas, for example, reports that smaller markdowns have resulted in a slight increase in average selling prices and Kansas City notes that retail prices continue to edge up. Chicago suggests there have been a few signs that consumer resistance to price increases has softened somewhat. In contrast, retailers in the New York district report that selling prices and merchandise costs have been flat to slightly down. Prices for manufacturing goods and materials have held steady, with modest increases for a few items, such as cardboard, packaging materials, metals, and ethylene-based petrochemicals. The big exception has been building materials, especially sheetrock, which continues to experience substantial price increases. Housing prices and commercial rental rates have also increased in several districts.",1,1
1999-05-31,"District reports indicate that the U.S. economy continues to operate at generally strong levels and to expand at a moderate pace. Consumer spending remains healthy, led by strong motor vehicle sales. Most Districts noted improvements in manufacturing activity; however, weak foreign demand is a problem for some industries in some regions. Both residential and commercial construction remain at high levels, although some slowing in the rate of expansion was noted in several Districts. Reports on agriculture have been mixed, while the outlook in the energy sector has improved. Loan demand is generally described as strong in many areas of the country. Most Districts continue to 
report tight labor markets, but these conditions are apparently not often translating into higher wages; however, there are reports that non-wage compensation is increasing. Prices generally remain stable, with the exception of oil and gas, and some building materials, which are in short supply. 
CONSUMER SPENDING 
Most areas of the country experienced year-over-year retail sales gains during March and April. Inventories continue to be balanced. Many Atlanta and Chicago retailers reported that the early Easter holiday shifted purchases into March while weakening April sales results. New York and Dallas reports indicate that sales growth has moderated since January and February, while sales have improved from earlier in the year in the Kansas City and Philadelphia Districts. Retailers in the Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City and Richmond regions expressed optimism going forward. 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before April 26, 1999. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii Motor vehicle sales grew at a healthy pace in most Districts in March and early April. Sales 
were strong in the Richmond, Kansas City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. In the Philadelphia District, sales of sports cars and luxury models increased, while sales of trucks and sports-utility vehicles held steady, demand was particularly strong for sports-utility vehicles in Dallas. Chicago reports that new and used light vehicle sales were robust. After a strong first 
quarter, some Cleveland dealers report a slowdown in early April. 
TOURISM AND CONVENTION BUSINESS 
The tourism and business travel sector continues to post strong numbers, according to most District reports. Tourist activity remains strong in most of Florida, according to Atlanta, but there is concern about a falloff in international visitors to south Florida. Gaming continues to thrive in Mississippi with large crowds packing a new resort. Richmond reports record attendance at Washington D.C.'s National Cherry Blossom Festival and an increase in popularity of coastal resorts. Inquiries are up substantially from a year ago for destinations in the Minneapolis District. 
Summer bookings are ahead of schedule in the St. Louis District. 
MANUFACTURING 
Most Districts report recent improvement in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing is generally strong in Chicago. In Philadelphia, there is a ""broad based improvement"" for some manufacturers. Boston reports that the strongest trends are in medical and automotive equipment suppliers, and most manufacturers contacted expect business to expand in coming months. Recently in Richmond, factory shipments and new orders have risen sharply. Some manufacturers in San Francisco continued to be hampered by international trade conditions, but demand for computers and electronic components remains stable, and production of telecommunications equipment is at high 
iii levels. Richmond and Atlanta report growing activity for makers of telecommunications and 
electronics equipment. Some industries that showed softness earlier in the year, such as industrial machinery components, have improved in Cleveland. Strength in housing markets and commercial construction is boosting orders for building materials in Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Dallas. In Minneapolis, while there are signs of expansion in the factory sector, the weak international economy is curtailing some firms' output. Foreign demand also remains weak for firms in Philadelphia. Chicago and Cleveland report that an inventory overhang has slowed an anticipated recovery in the steel industry. Apparel production and orders remain below those of a year ago in the Atlanta region, and some contacts there are not optimistic about the near-term outlook because 
of fierce foreign competition. Aerospace production has softened in the Cleveland District. 
REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Reports on residential construction varied around the country. The pace of residential building remained brisk in the Cleveland District, with some recent improvement. New York also reported strong recent growth in permits. Home construction is described as ""vigorous"" in California. Minneapolis reported large year-over-year increases in housing permits in some areas. In Atlanta, new home construction was flat to up slightly since late 1998. Some parts of the Kansas City District experienced starts slightly below last year's pace. February permits in the St. Louis region improved from earlier in the year but remained below year-ago levels. 
Overall, home sales continue at healthy levels and demand remains strong. In the Chicago District, existing home sales remained brisk in most areas, exceeding expectations. Home sales have strengthened since February in the Kansas City region, while Realtors in the Richmond District report significant increases in home sales. Many areas of the St. Louis region are being referred to 
iv as a ""sellers market,"" and the New York housing market is described as ""tight."" Boston markets are 
characterized by strong demand and improving sales. Most Realtors in the Atlanta District said that home sales were mixed in March and flat in early April. 
Commercial construction continued at strong levels in most Districts, although there were a few reports of slowing activity. In the Atlanta District, continuing high levels of commercial building fell somewhat below the year-ago level. Construction is described as strong in the Chicago District and continues at a brisk pace in the San Francisco District. Occupancy rates stabilized during the first quarter in New York, while leasing costs escalated. Construction is running ahead of last year's levels in the Minneapolis region, while development was recently mixed in markets in the Cleveland District. FINANCIAL SERVICES 
District reports on banking activity indicated that overall loan demand remains fairly strong. The Dallas, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts report that lending growth was robust. Lending increased in the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and New York Districts but declined in the St. Louis District and was mixed across sectors in Cleveland. Consumer credit grew strongly in the Dallas, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts, leveled off in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts, and decreased slightly in the Kansas City District. Commercial loan demand was strong in the Richmond and Chicago Districts, expanded in the Philadelphia, Kansas City, Atlanta, St. Louis, and New York Districts, and flattened in the Dallas and Cleveland Districts. Mortgage demand grew in Kansas 
City. Refinancing slowed in the Richmond, Atlanta, and New York Districts. Credit quality was little changed overall. In New York there was some tightening of standards for commercial loans, and delinquency rates fell on consumer loans. The quality of 
V 
business and consumer loans was good, and consumer delinquencies were down in Chicago. There have been no changes in credit quality, and consumer and commercial delinquencies remain low in Cleveland, and little change in credit standards in the Richmond region. Intense competition may have led to some relaxation in terms and covenants in the commercial sector in Atlanta. AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
Agricultural reports were mixed across the country in March and early April. In Minneapolis, agriculture is still in the doldrums, as depressed livestock, corn, soybean, and wheat prices continue to hurt farmers. While Texas livestock conditions remained mostly good, lack of winter preparation damaged some of the wheat crop. Farmers made good progress on spring tillage and planting in recent weeks reports the Richmond District, and in the Kansas City District the 
winter wheat crop remains in good shape, and growing conditions continue to be generally favorable. Reports from Chicago indicate that low commodity prices continued to adversely impact farmers as spring plantings began; sales of many agricultural products were hampered by weak export demand in San Francisco. Weather has been favorable for farmers, and crops are reported to be ahead of schedule for the season in the Cleveland District, while St. Louis reports that favorable weather conditions and abundant moisture levels have resulted in a winter wheat crop that is in 
mostly good-to-excellent condition. The energy sector is stabilizing. Natural gas exploration has picked up recently, but oil 
exploration still remains weak in the Minneapolis District. In the Dallas District, drilling has not increased in response to higher oil and natural gas prices. After declining in March, the rig count in the Kansas City District began to edge up during the first few weeks in April, and Atlanta reports 
vi that rising oil and gas prices have improved the outlook for Louisiana companies linked to the oil 
and gas industry. 
WAGES AND PRICES 
Most Districts continue to report tight labor markets, but there were no reports of significant pickup in wage increases. Some reports, however, indicate that firms are increasing non-wage compensation for higher-level personnel and are using hiring and retention bonuses to attract and hold on to skilled workers. In Chicago, concerns about labor shortages have become more pronounced. Shortages of qualified truck drivers have slowed shipping growth in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Chicago. In Minneapolis and New York, labor shortages have forced manufacturing plants to move to other regions. Tight labor markets in St. Louis are affecting many firms' plans for expansion or relocation, but wage pressures remain subdued. Labor shortages are adversely affecting builders in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. Despite continued remarks noting tight labor markets in St. Louis, comments about wage pressures from contacts there have been ""noticeably lacking."" 
Most prices remain stable. Building materials prices, especially for sheetrock, are increasing in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Boston regions. Contracted services costs have increased in New York. Low commodity prices in Minneapolis persist in depressing farm income and are curbing metal mining.",1,0
1999-04-30,"SUMMARY1 
The districts reported some further gains in economic activity in January and February, despite weakness in agriculture and a few manufacturing industries. Consumer 
spending continued to display strength, aided by post-holiday price discounting and mild weather in some regions. Motor vehicle sales increased, led by light trucks, and furniture sales benefited from robust home sales. Manufacturing activity expanded in most districts, although foreign competition and low energy prices depressed textile, apparel, and energy-related industries. Commercial real estate and construction activity, already at a high level, grew at a brisk pace in most districts. Residential construction was strong in most regions. Several districts reported a pickup in business lending, and a few noted that lenders' standards were stable to slightly tighter. Agriculture continued to be plagued by low farm commodity prices, and an increasing number of farmers were under financial stress. Labor markets remained tight. Finding qualified workers has become more difficult in several districts, and reports of faster wage increases were more widespread than in recent months. Prices of most goods remained little changed, and several districts said that businesses remain reluctant to press for price increases. 
Consumer Spending: Retail sales remained strong in the first two months of the year, and most districts reported that activity was substantially higher than a year ago. 
Inventories were balanced and in line with future sales expectations. Boston, New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas experienced faster-than-expected sales growth, while in 
Atlanta, sales were flat or up only slightly from the prior year. In the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts, substantial post-holiday price discounting helped move winter merchandise and boost sales, while Cleveland reported strong sales despite unusually small discounts. Healthy housing markets supported strong demand for furniture and home products in Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Apparel sales were lackluster in New York and Richmond but remained strong in Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago. 
1Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based on information collected before March 8, 1999. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal 
Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Automobile sales increased in many districts in January and February. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco noted that motor vehicle sales--especially of sport-utility vehicles and light trucks--strengthened compared to December. Auto sales were lagging in Kansas City and flat in Minneapolis. 
Two districts had upbeat reports on tourism. Resort activity was up from a year ago in the Atlanta District, while in Minneapolis skiing revenues were strong. In the Richmond District, mild weather damped revenues at ski areas but helped tourism in 
coastal regions. New York noted that their tourism boom had leveled off and that hotel occupancy rates had fallen. 
Manufacturing: The tone of manufacturing improved in most districts, although some industries continued to be hampered by foreign competition. Growth in overall manufacturing activity strengthened in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. In the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas districts, manufacturing was described as mixed, while Kansas City said that its manufacturing sector remained weak. 
Motor vehicle production moved higher in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco districts. In Cleveland and Chicago, heavy truck orders exceeded analysts' expectations in February and led some to raise their sales forecasts for 1999. The Boston 
and Richmond districts noted strength in the furniture industry, while St. Louis characterized its furniture industry as mixed. Several districts noted that shipments of semiconductors and high-tech equipment increased. Expectations for business conditions in coming months were mostly positive. Boston, for example, reported that most manufacturers' expectations were positive but cautious for 1999. Producers in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts expected orders and output to increase over the next six months. 
Construction and Real Estate: Residential real estate activity remained vigorous in nearly all districts. Increases in housing starts were reported in the New 
York, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. Residential construction was particularly active in Ohio, where some of the activity was 
described as speculative. Also, residential construction was said to be running at a record pace in St. Louis, and in the Minneapolis District, reports of increased residential 
iii 
construction were widespread. In contrast, new home construction eased a bit in the Atlanta, Dallas, and parts of the San Francisco District. 
Contacts in the Chicago District indicated that existing home sales have slowed since December. Housing sales were described as brisk in the New York. Philadelphia, 
and Dallas districts. New home purchases were above the previous year's level in Kansas City and builders there were optimistic about the next few months. Home prices 
moved higher in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis districts. 
In the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts, construction costs increased in recent weeks. Drywall and insulation shortages, as well as tight markets for skilled labor, placed upward pressure on prices. In contrast, San Francisco reported that lower labor costs in Utah and sluggish activity in Oregon had slowed construction cost increases in those areas. 
Commercial real estate activity remained strong in most districts, although there were a few reports of slowing activity. Competition for commercial space intensified in the Carolinas. Rental rates rose in the New York and Philadelphia districts, and reached record high levels in the San Francisco Bay area. Chicago and Minneapolis noted faster growth in construction activity, particularly of public works projects. Boston reported an uptick in activity around Hartford, Connecticut, with several new construction projects planned. In contrast, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reported slowdowns in new construction, while activity in the Cleveland District was described as flat. Office leasing was said to be leveling off in Boston, and in the St. Louis District vacancy rates rose in central business districts. 
Banking and Finance: Lenders were upbeat in most districts. Atlanta and San Francisco reported that overall demand for loans remained strong, and New York and Kansas City said that loans or loan demand picked up in recent weeks. Several districts noted strength in specific categories of lending: Chicago cited strong demand for consumer and business loans, while Dallas said that auto lending and home equity refinancing showed ""signs of strength."" Overall loan volumes were steady in Philadelphia and Richmond. Higher mortgage rates slowed the pace of lending in Richmond and caused a drop in loan originations and refinancing applications for some 
iv 
banks in the Chicago District. The only district reporting a decline in overall lending was St. Louis, where total loans at a group of large banks was said to be down 2.5 percent since the beginning ofthe year. 
Reports on credit quality and delinquency rates were mixed. Chicago said that credit quality improved and New York reported lower delinquency rates for all types of 
loans. Cleveland, however, noted that many banks reported higher delinquency rates. In addition, automobile dealers in the Cleveland District expressed concerns about the credit worthiness of some new car buyers. San Francisco said that the only report of deteriorating credit quality was from the Oregon coast, where loan delinquencies rose. 
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices: Labor markets remained taut with higher employment levels reported in nearly all districts. Employers in the Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts continued to experience difficulty finding qualified workers. Markets for retail labor remained tight across much of the nation, especially in the New York and Kansas City districts, where finding even entry-level workers was said to be difficult. Cleveland also said that retail labor conditions remained tight, but somewhat less so than in December. Retailers in the Richmond District trimmed workers in an effort to control costs. 
Temporary employment firms faced strong demand for their services in January and February. Boston and Chicago indicated that more businesses had recently turned to temporary employment firms to find workers. Cleveland and Richmond reported that temporary help firms were unable to meet their clients' demand for workers, raising the probability of future wage increases. The demand for contingent workers was mixed in the Dallas District, where requests from telecommunications firms, call centers, and banks remained at high levels, although demand from manufacturing and oil companies slackened. 
Manufacturing employment was mixed across districts in January and February. St. Louis manufacturers increased their workforces, and plants in the Philadelphia District planned to add workers and lengthen the workweek in coming months. Boston and Richmond reported steady manufacturing employment, while declines were cited by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. 
The Boston, Cleveland, Richmond. Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts reported greater upward wage pressures in January and February. Generally stable wages were reported by New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Most districts indicated that higher wage costs were absorbed by businesses. 
Low commodity prices and a perceived lack of pricing power by firms helped keep prices stable during January and February. Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, 
Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported generally steady prices, while Dallas indicated that price declines outnumbered price increases in that 
district. Rising lumber and drywall prices were reported by Cleveland and Minneapolis, while insulation and sheetrock prices inched up in the Kansas City District. Escalating health care costs continued to plague employers in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources: The weather had mixed impacts on agricultural production across the districts, and low commodity prices affected both agricultural and energy producers. Respondents from Richmond and Minneapolis said that above-normal temperatures generally improved crop and pasture conditions and reduced the need for supplemental feeding of livestock in some areas. Richmond and Kansas City noted, however, that warm weather had accelerated crop development, which increased the potential for frost damage. San Francisco reported ""severe damage"" to its citrus crop from a late December freeze. Agricultural banks in several districts stated that weak commodity prices had caused financial hardship for some farmers. Lenders in the Chicago District experienced a drop offin agricultural loan repayment rates compared to a year ago, and some hog farmers in the Kansas City District liquidated herds earlier than normal. Both districts noted that credit standards for agricultural loans had recently been raised. Contacts in the Dallas District said that a greater number of producers had left the farming business recently. In the energy sector, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported that falling oil prices were causing some oil and gas wells to be withdrawn from production.",1,1
1999-02-28,"According to reports from business contacts in the twelve Federal Reserve districts, most regions are showing solid economic growth overall, despite mixed or weak results for individual sectors in some areas. New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond report a pickup in activity recently, while Boston, Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicate that the pace of growth for at least some sectors has slowed. 
Most districts report generally stable or declining prices for both producers and consumers, but exceptions exist. For example, home prices are rising in some districts, fees for 
services are said to be up in Dallas, and Boston mentions price increases by selected manufacturers. Energy and most agricultural prices are low by historical standards. Retail 
discounting just before Christmas and around the turn of the year was more extensive than usual in some areas. 
Reports from all districts mention labor market tightness, with Atlanta, Chicago, and Richmond recording heightened wage pressures in some sectors and St. Louis citing increased 
worker ""poaching."" However, the Kansas City, Boston, and San Francisco districts say some extreme shortages have eased. 
Looking forward, business contacts in most districts remain optimistic about 1999, especially the first half. Philadelphia and Atlanta indicate that some contacts expect business activity to accelerate early this year. However, respondents in most districts expect somewhat

slower growth in 1999 than in 1998. Consumer Spending 
ii 
Most districts report that retail sales grew at a moderate pace during the holiday period. By exception, the Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis districts experienced brisk sales growth. Respondents in the Boston and Philadelphia districts cite mixed sales results, with some sectors showing strong activity and other sectors experiencing softness. Only in the Atlanta district do contacts report weak holiday sales, up only slightly from a year earlier. 
Retailers in many districts report a surge in sales late in the season, led by extensive price discounting, which brought inventories to desired levels. Only in the St. Louis district are retail inventories said to be higher than desired. Sales of consumer durables are reportedly strong in every district, with the most robust results in home appliances, home furnishings, consumer electronics, and automobiles. By contrast, unseasonably warm weather in most of December weakened sales of winter apparel and tourist activity in many districts; some districts report a pickup in winter merchandise sales with the advent of cold weather. Discount retailers reportedly profited more from the late buying surge than did department stores. 
There is little evidence ofprice pressures at the retail level and most districts say that retail wages are rising moderately. In almost all districts, retailers discounted extensively, but where consumer demand was very strong, less discounting occurred, leaving consumer prices about flat. Manufacturing 
Many districts report mixed results in manufacturing. On the whole, Dallas notes continuing expansion, and Philadelphia and St. Louis indicate some recent pickup. By contrast, 
iii New York and Kansas City report overall declines, while Atlanta indicates that factory activity 
remains sluggish. The Cleveland and Chicago reports cite strong production and expectations of continued 
strength in the motor vehicle industry. Respondents in Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco indicate positive trends in construction-related manufacturing; in Dallas this sector is flat, although orders for cement remain at a high level. Boston and San Francisco cite medical equipment as a bright spot. 
Various districts mention depressed revenues for producers ofpaper, steel, agricultural equipment, and oil-related products. Boston and Dallas report that the semiconductor industry is doing substantially worse than a year ago but seems poised to stabilize or improve in coming months. Almost every district cites examples of manufacturers whose business is being hurt by weak exports, particularly to Asia. 
In most cases, industrial prices are flat or falling. Steel and paper prices reportedly are under intense downward pressure as a result of import competition (and, in the case of paper, weak demand). Prices for refined petroleum and petroleum derivatives remain low or have fallen, and Dallas reports that full capacity utilization has resulted in ""huge"" inventories of home heating oil. Chicago and Kansas City mention price increases for some construction materials. 
Manufacturers face disparate labor market conditions across the country, according to district summaries. For instance, Chicago indicates ongoing softness in the demand for manufacturing help, while San Francisco says that filling vacancies remains difficult. On the whole, pay pressures in manufacturing seem unchanged or slightly more moderate than in the recent past. Some workers are experiencing a weaker job market because of recent layoffs, 
especially in trade-sensitive sectors or regions. Business Services 
Districts reporting on the business services sector describe an extremely tight labor market. Most districts also report both wage increases and stable selling prices. In Cleveland, New York, and Dallas, temporary employment firms are having difficulty finding workers to fill their orders. Customer service workers, secretaries, and receptionists are in high demand in Cleveland. In Dallas, contacts report strong demand for system programmers and other computer-related workers. Though job growth in business services appears generally strong, some exceptions exist. Contacts at temporary employment firms in Richmond and Chicago note ongoing softness in the manufacturing sector. In both Richmond and San Francisco, service activity, including legal and accounting, was flat. Construction and Real Estate 
Many districts report unusually high levels of real estate activity in November and December. Residential construction did not experience typical slowdowns in December; 
unseasonably mild winter weather and favorable demand conditions are cited as explanations. High levels of new home construction are reported by the New York, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. Chicago and Minneapolis are experiencing very strong markets for new construction, with large increases in the number of permits and new home sales. Commercial development is also robust in the Chicago and San Francisco districts. Labor markets are tight in several districts, with especially short supplies of skilled tradesmen, such as plumbers and electricians. 
Existing home sales are strong as well. Parts ofthe Boston, New York, and Chicago 
V 
districts tallied record sales of existing homes in November or December. Other districts, including Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco report high but stable levels of sales. Small or moderate increases in home prices are reported by Boston, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis. 
The commercial real estate market is moderately active. New York and Richmond report small increases in office rental rates. Office vacancy rates are increasing slightly in the tight Manhattan market, but declining in Minneapolis-St. Paul and the Richmond district. Financial Services 
Districts reporting on banking activity indicate that demand for commercial loans is mixed. Dallas reports that an earlier slowing in commercial lending has abated, while New York notes a seasonal decline in commercial lending in December. Business lending expanded at a healthy pace in Atlanta. Some tightening of underwriting standards is reported by Philadelphia, San Francisco, and New York. Some banks in Cleveland note adverse effects of the Asian crisis on their industrial customers. Most districts report continued strong demand for residential mortgages. Refinancing activity was especially strong in Atlanta while Philadelphia reports large increases in mortgages to finance newly built homes. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agriculture, oil, and mining continue to face financial pressures. According to contacts in the Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts, low prices for cattle, hogs, wheat, feed grains, cotton, and some vegetables have been squeezing profits and, in some cases, failing to cover production costs. Large domestic supplies, falling demand for feed stocks, and reduced exports are reportedly responsible for the low prices. Hog farmers have been particularly hard hit; hog prices in mid-December were at 30-year lows and nearly 60 
vi percent below late 1997 levels, although Chicago reports that hog prices recovered modestly in 
early January. In general, unless prices improve, many farmers expect to lose money in 1999, and agricultural lenders in the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts express some concern about future loan repayments and borrower solvency. By contrast, dairy farmers are facing the most favorable milk-to-feed-cost ratios in years. Looking ahead, some contacts in the San Francisco district report a pickup in export orders, especially for meat. The late December freeze did little apparent harm to winter crops except in California, where the cold damaged 50 to 70 percent of the citrus crop. 
Conditions in energy and mining worsened late last year, according to respondents in Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas, despite the cold snap in late December that 
pushed natural gas prices up slightly. Contacts in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas report that U.S. rig counts are near post-World War II lows. The rig count has fallen 34 percent, year-over-year, in the Kansas City district and by even larger percentages in Montana and North Dakota. Energy producers have cut exploration, capital spending, and production plans; demand for capital equipment and oil services is deteriorating, and, in the Dallas district, energy sector layoffs are widespread. Contacts in the Minneapolis district also report that copper prices are near shutdown levels at Montana mines, while Minnesota and Michigan iron mines expect to see significant drops in output in 1999 because of increased imports of iron ore and finished steel.",1,0
1998-11-30,"Summary. District reports suggested that the pace of economic expansion moderated in September and October amid signs of slowing in some sectors. Retail sales were mostly at or below merchants' expectations, but there were only scattered reports of unanticipated inventory accumulation. Real estate and construction activity remained generally robust, especially in residential markets, but most Districts reported that more stringent credit standards were a factor slowing commercial real estate activity. Manufacturing activity continued at relatively high levels, but was the sector most often cited as showing signs of softening. Lending activity varied by region, with demand remaining strong, although many lenders were reported to be tightening standards somewhat, mostly on business loans. Labor markets remained very tight in most Districts, although demand for workers in manufacturing industries was softening in some areas. Crop conditions varied across Districts as the fall harvest progressed. Low commodity prices and adverse weather conditions in some areas were increasing concerns among farmers and agricultural banks. Upward pressure on most wages remained subdued. Prices at the retail level were little changed, while producers' prices for intermediate inputs were generally flat to down. 
Virtually all Districts reported that businesses and consumers remained cautious about the economic outlook. Boston and St. Louis noted increasing concern while Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis reported a modestly improved outlook. 
Consumer spending/tourism. Most Districts reported slowing retail sales growth with results coming in at or slightly below most merchants' expectations. However, the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, and San Francisco reports suggested that sales gains were moderate to strong. Discounters were reported to be outperforming other retailers in some Districts. Light vehicle sales were picking up in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts while softening

in Philadelphia, Dallas, and Kansas City. Sales of other big-ticket items (such as jewelry, home furnishings, electronics, appliances, etc.) were strong in many Districts, but mixed in Chicago and soft in San Francisco. Apparel sales picked up as the weather cooled in the Chicago District but remained slow in New York and San Francisco. Retailers in most areas reported satisfactory inventory levels, but there were a few reports of inventory overhangs. 
However, only the Chicago District noted greater-than-usual promotional activity to clear them. Tourism and travel spending was reported to be very strong in the Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, 
but slowed in the Atlanta region where Hurricane Georges and weakness in Latin American economies hindered travel. 
Construction/real estate. Residential building and sales continued strong, but generally flat, in most of the country. The Richmond District reported an increase in new housing activity, while Atlanta and Kansas City suggested some softening. New York indicated general strength with pockets of weakness, particularly in the New York City area. The pattern was similar for existing home sales, with most regions reporting solid, but flat, sales volumes. The Chicago District noted exceptional activity in September, with no signs of the typical seasonal slowdown in October. Atlanta and Richmond said sales of existing homes had softened somewhat recently. The Chicago and Richmond Districts reported some weakness in sales of higher priced homes, the former attributing this to recent volatility in financial markets. 
Nonresidential construction activity, both private and public, remained strong in most Districts, although there were signs of softening in commercial real estate markets. St. Louis and Richmond reported noticeable decreases in speculative building. A contact in the Richmond District attributed the weakness, in part, to the lack of credit, adding that ""spec"" development that wasn't already underway had come to a halt. Minneapolis, on the other hand, was reporting the strongest office market in over a decade. 
Manufacturing. Reports indicate that growth in overall manufacturing activity slowed in 11 of the 12 Districts. St. Louis was the only District not reporting overall softening, with its strength due largely to production of transportation equipment. Three-quarters of the Districts 
iii 
indicated that economic turmoil abroad, especially in East Asia, was at least partially responsible for softening demand. Steel producers in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago regions attributed a significant slowdown to a dramatic increase in imported steel over the late summer and early fall. Producers of semiconductors and other high-tech equipment noted decreased shipments in half of the Districts. Agricultural equipment makers cut fourth-quarter output schedules, but producers of other heavy equipment continued to run near capacity. Production in the auto industry picked up amid efforts to restock strike-depleted inventories. Increased shipments of personal computers were noted by the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. 
Banking. Business lending activity was mixed across Districts, while low interest rates buoyed consumer and home mortgage lending activity. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis reported increasing business lending, while Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted declines. Most regions continued to experience strong demand for business loans, but increased uncertainty about economic conditions made lenders more cautious. Tightening of credit terms or standards on business loans was reported in two-thirds of the Districts, with the majority of them pointing to a less favorable economic outlook as justification. Commercial real estate was the segment most often targeted for tightening though there were a few reports of tightening on merger and acquisition lending. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts suggested that there was a pickup in loan demand from borrowers who typically would have gone through other channels such as capital and equity markets. 
Consumer lending activity was reportedly strong in most Districts, especially in New York, Chicago, and Kansas City. Cleveland noted a further softening of consumer lending conditions from their last report. Mortgage originations and refinancing activity picked up as mortgage interest rates fell. Asset quality on consumer loans was generally unchanged from the last Beige Book report, and only two Districts--New York and Kansas City--reported tightening standards, albeit modest. 
Concerns at agricultural banks continued as low commodity prices persisted. Chicago reported that after a few good years most farmers could withstand the low prices this year, but could falter if soft prices continued well into next year. Banks in the Minneapolis District 
iv 
continued to be very concerned, as some banks sought to diversify by branching into urban markets. Lenders in the Kansas City District noted a deterioration in their agricultural portfolios from last year. 
Labor markets, wages, and prices. Labor markets remained very tight in most Districts, but there were few new reports of intensifying wage pressures. Dallas was the only District to indicate ""marked"" slackening in some labor market segments. Reports suggested that labor market tightness continued to hamper business creation and expansion plans in some areas. Contacts in the Atlanta District reported difficulty in finding mid-level managers for positions that were downsized just a few years ago. Shortages of workers persisted in most areas, but appeared to be no more pronounced than in previous reports. Information technology, skilled 
trades, and construction workers were most often cited as being in short supply. Reflecting a general softening in the industrial sector, manufacturing employment reportedly declined in nearly half the Districts, while St. Louis and Kansas City indicated increased hiring in some segments. The Boston and New York Districts noted layoffs and bonus reductions in the financial services industry due to recent volatility in financial markets. By 
contrast, the Chicago District noted little effect. Upward pressure on wages and prices remained generally subdued, according to most 
District reports. Cleveland, however, noted that temporary help agencies had increased wages in order to fill positions in the last three months. Contacts in the Atlanta District suggested that, while wages continued to go up in parts of the region, employers were absorbing most of the added costs and not passing them along in the form of higher prices. Most producers' input prices declined while output prices generally remained flat. The general tce of District reports suggests little, if any, change in retail price pressures. 
Agriculture. Agricultural conditions varied widely across regions and concern about deterioration in financial conditions in the industry increased. The fall harvest generally progressed at or ahead of normal in the Midwestern Districts. Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported that corn and soybean yields and quality were good to excellent. 
However, crop conditions in the southern and western U.S. were decidedly less favorable. Dallas noted that conditions remained very difficult, with the combination of bad weather, high costs, and low prices leaving many agricultural operations in serious financial shape. St. Louis observed that weather conditions in the southern part of its District had adversely affected crop conditions. San Francisco reported that poor yields and a late harvest adversely affected the 
California industry. With the exception of dairy producers, who were benefitting from low feed costs and near 
record product prices, the industry was facing low prices that resulted from the squeeze generated by a substantial carryover, large new crop production, and a marked cutback in demand from foreign markets, Asia in particular. Contacts in the Dallas District noted that as many as 25 percent of the region's producers would discontinue production over the next year. Kansas City observed that the downturn in the farm economy was also being felt by rural ""Main Street"" businesses, and farm equipment dealers and manufacturers. 
Other Natural Resources. Activity in the extractive industries continued weak. Kansas City noted that an increase in oil prices in September had resulted in a marginal gain in energy activity; however, declining prices in October were expected to reverse that move. Dallas observed that energy activity continued to decline in that region and that oil directed drilling was near an all-time low. Severe weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico forced temporary abandonment of some drilling rigs, but damage was less than expected. Minneapolis noted that an increase in steel imports forced the curtailment of activity in some Minnesota iron mines.",1,1
1998-10-31,"The overall tenor of the District reports suggests that the economy is continuing to expand at a moderate pace, although several Districts indicated slowing in some sectors. Notably, the New York District reports that significant segments of its economy were slowing, and the Dallas District notes that economic activity decelerated in August as the manufacturing sector declined. Still, most Districts see at least modest growth in business activity from generally high levels. Despite some continuing-and in some cases 
increasing-softness in certain industries due to the weakened Asian economies, many Districts indicate unusually high levels of construction and good retail sales growth. 
While there appear to be only marginal changes in the strength and pattern of the business expansion since the last report, several Districts indicate a sharp deterioration in both business and household expectations regarding the economy in the fourth quarter and in 1999. The Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts all report a less buoyant economic outlook than earlier, and the Boston District sees increased uncertainty about 1999. In the Minneapolis District, ""the number of sources expressing concern about the near future is striking."" 
A large number of Districts continue to exhibit labor market tightness, which appears to be pushing wages up at a faster pace. On the other hand, retail prices remain

ii generally steady or are declining slightly in most Districts, and falling import prices have 
helped push industrial commodity prices lower. 
Construction 
Construction activity is characterized as very strong across the nation, although a few Districts report signs of slowing in some markets from high levels of activity. New and existing home sales remain high in most areas, and low inventories of unsold homes were noted in the Atlanta and Kansas City regions. Office vacancies are low or falling in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts, although the St. Louis District has seen vacancy rates creep up slightly. In the Dallas region, there is concern about overbuilt industrial space. 
The unusually strong growth in building activity appears to be constrained by the availability of construction workers in some areas. The Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago 
Districts note shortages of construction workers; for the San Francisco District, finding qualified construction workers posed a significant obstacle to new construction in areas where building is brisk. Rents are rising in the New York and Philadelphia regions. Retail Sales 
Retail sales remain strong in many Districts. Leading categories in recent sales growth include electronics, appliances, and furniture. Apparel items were also thought to be selling especially well. While a few Districts describe back-to-school sales as spotty, these results may have been affected by the timing of the Labor Day holiday weekend (which is not captured in this report.) In addition, auto sales were mixed by region and by 
iii model. In some cases, a continued shortage of General Motors products was thought to 
be still restraining auto sales. Retailers were mixed in their reaction to the recent fluctuations in U.S. and foreign 
capital markets. Boston notes some uncertainty among retailers they contacted concerning a possible fallout from financial market turmoil for 1999 and beyond, although the St. Louis District reports that retailers there have not yet observed a falloff in sales because of swings in the stock markets and are optimistic about sales prospects for the rest of the year. Similarly, contacts in the Richmond District remarked that retailers there do not expect the recent volatility in financial markets to trim their sales in the coming months. Manufacturing 
The industrial sector continues to be affected by softness in the Asian economies. Chemicals, construction materials including steel, textiles, and some types of capital goods industries have been hurt by reduced exports to Asia. Nevertheless, domestic demand continues to keep industrial activity steady at a relatively high level in many, if not most, regions. 
Domestic orders growth appears to be holding nearly steady or rising slightly in many regions. In the Boston District, orders for medical equipment are said to be rising 
strongly. A few Districts indicate a drop in computer-related manufacturing. In the Dallas region, demand for semiconductors is said to be still weak; in the San Francisco District, sales and market conditions weakened for computer and electronics manufacturers. 
Agriculture 
Agricultural conditions vary greatly by region. In the Midwest, including the Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and northern St. Louis Districts, crop conditions are highly favorable. The Kansas City District expects a bumper crop of corn and soybeans, except in Oklahoma where drought damage has been severe. Bad weather conditions are thought to have reduced yields in the Dallas and San Francisco regions, and Hurricane Bonnie is reported to have caused significant crop damage in some parts of the Richmond 
District. The Districts report that the combined influence of generally good harvests and 
weak foreign demand has exerted considerable downward pressure on agricultural commodity prices. In several cases, these influences are thought to be putting stress on 
farmers' balance sheets. The Dallas District indicates that low yields and low prices have led to serious financial stress for many crop producers; in the Minneapolis region, where high yields are not sufficient to offset the low crop prices, farmers reportedly face the most serious financial situation in a decade. Kansas City, however, reports that agricultural bankers in its region were not especially concerned about low crop prices. 
Labor Markets and Wages 
Labor shortages are still being reported in most regions, and many Districts have seen an accelerated rate of compensation growth. The workers in greatest demand are 
information systems personnel, including programmers. Construction and retail workers are generally thought to be in short supply. The District reports also note insufficient numbers of engineers, architects, investment managers, bus drivers, and administrative 
v 
assistants. The Boston District indicates that worker shortages are impinging on retail expansion plans. In the Cleveland District, there are concerns that farm worker shortages will make it difficult to harvest Kentucky's tobacco crop. In the Kansas City region, employers are having difficulty hiring at almost all levels. 
Most, although not all, Districts have seen a pickup in compensation growth this year. Wage increases are somewhat higher in many areas, although sharply higher growth 
rates are seen only in fields where labor shortages have become critical, such as information systems. The Chicago District sees wage growth as stable but reports increased nonwage compensation. Minneapolis notes that strikes have become a more prominent feature of the collective bargaining environment than in recent years. 
Prices 
The District reports show wide agreement that price pressures remain relatively subdued. Falling import prices are said to be having a major impact on a variety of retail goods prices, such as apparel, consumer electronics, and food. However, the San Francisco region notes that prices for services such as airline travel, health care, and cable TV have started to rise significantly. 
Manufacturing prices are flat, and in some industries, such as lumber, petrochemicals, steel, and a number of other commodities, prices have been falling. The only significant upward movement has occurred in the construction materials industry, with prices rising in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City regions. 
Banking 
Loan demands are mixed by region and by category. In the New York and Philadelphia Districts, loan volumes have been declining recently, although seasonal factors may be at work in the former case. On the other hand, lending activity remains brisk in the Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco regions. In the Cleveland District, demand for commercial loans continues to strengthen, but consumer borrowing has been 
flat. In the Kansas City region, consumer, mortgage, and agricultural loans increased, while other loan categories held steady. 
Credit quality also varies by region. Delinquency rates are reported unchanged in the Cleveland District and are stable to slightly lower in the New York District. In the Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco regions, credit standards have deteriorated, although a few banks in the Dallas District have tightened lending standards recently.",1,1
1998-08-31,"Reports from Federal Reserve Districts generally indicated a high level of economic activity and further expansion recently, though with moderation in growth for some regions and sectors. In most Districts, retail sales were in line with retailers' expectations, and inventories generally were characterized as balanced. Manufacturing activity remained at a high level, although the GM strike, weakening demand for exports, and general slowing in the high-tech sector damped expansion. Robust sales growth in residential and commercial real estate markets continued to fuel construction activity in most of the nation. Reports on the agricultural sector were mixed, with drought-like weather in the South and low prices for some products tempering the outlook. Financial institutions across the country continued to report healthy loan demand and generally accommodative credit conditions. Despite the high level of economic activity in recent weeks, many Districts noted that labor shortages, shipping bottlenecks, and continued weakness in East Asia were beginning to temper growth in their regions. Consumer Spending 
Retail sales increased in most Districts in late June and July. Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, and Minneapolis reported strong sales growth since the last report, often exceeding merchants' expectations. Among other Districts, Chicago, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco reported steady but healthy retail sales, while reports from Atlanta and Richmond 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected before July 27, 1998. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views ofFederal Reserve officials. 
ii indicated mixed sales results. In general, consumer spending remained robust across many 
product lines and types of outlets. Sales were strongest for seasonal women's and children's apparel and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles, home furnishings, and major appliances. 
Retailers attributed the continued strength of retail sales to strong consumer confidence, robust home sales creating demand for complementary items, and favorable financing terms for large purchases. 
For the most part, retailers reported that inventories were adequate for anticipated sales growth. However, shortfalls were noted for some products. Unseasonably hot weather caught Midwest retailers with inadequate inventories of fans and air conditioners. Declining inventories of GM products constrained sales at GM dealers and service centers across the country, but other auto dealers reportedly maintained sufficient supplies of new cars and parts. 
Tourist activity picked up in recent weeks, as the summer travel season got under way. At beach resorts along the East Coast, hotel bookings and day trip traffic reportedly surpassed year- earlier levels. In Boston, increased tourist traffic from Europe offset declines in business from East Asia and contributed to the sector's robust growth. Fires depressed tourism in much of Florida, but other parts of the Southeast attracted visitors, including those interested in riverboat gambling and Mississippi Gulf Coast casinos. In the West, tourism-related restaurant sales, car rentals, and hotel occupancy rates reportedly were strong, and attendance at parks such as Yellowstone and Mount Rushmore rose above year-earlier levels. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity remained at a high level in recent weeks, although growth slowed in most Districts. Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and St. Louis reported good growth in 
iii non-GM related manufacturing. In Boston and Dallas, telecommunications manufacturers 
reported good sales gains; in Chicago strong demand for construction equipment and building materials kept producers running near capacity in recent weeks; in St. Louis, robust demand for 
refrigerators and other appliances induced overtime hours for some producers. In general, manufacturers reported no difficulties obtaining materials or supplies, and prices on many inputs to production were either flat or declined. 
The GM strike and continued weakness in East Asia slowed manufacturing growth in many regions. In the Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, New York, and St. Louis Districts the GM strike directly reduced manufacturing employment, idling workers at GM plants and related suppliers in these areas. The GM strike also affected electronics manufacturers in Dallas and chemical, plastic, and steel producers in Cleveland. Weakness in East Asia and increased low- cost imports continued to depress demand for a variety of U.S. products. Manufacturers reported that sales and orders for apparel and textiles, computing equipment, electronic components, industrial machinery, paper, and wood products fell in many Districts. Reports also indicated employment reductions through layoffs or attrition at some companies. Construction and Real Estate 
Construction activity and real estate markets remained robust in most parts of the nation. Home sales were characterized as strong to booming in Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond, and St. Louis, and above year-earlier levels in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, and San Francisco. Low mortgage interest rates continued to attract first-time buyers, fueling demand for low to moderately priced homes in many regions. Only Richmond reported concerns about an 
iv 
excess supply of homes on the market; all other Districts indicated that housing inventories were low to moderate and consistent with the strong growth in home demand. 
Commercial real estate demand also grew rapidly in many areas, although growth was less uniform across Districts than for residential markets. Declining vacancy rates and increasing rental prices were present in a number of cities. In Boston, low availability and limited new construction of commercial space have forced some large and growing firms to relocate to the suburbs. In Manhattan, asking rents on Class A properties have risen 25 percent since last year. In Minneapolis and St. Paul, construction of large office buildings was at its highest level in a decade. In the West, respondents from California reported that low vacancy rates for commercial office and warehouse space have prompted commercial and industrial construction in the tightest markets. Only Dallas expressed concern about over building. Non-Financial Services 
Districts reporting on the services sector indicated continued strong growth in recent weeks. In Dallas, demand for business services continued to rise, fueled by initial public offerings, mergers, and acquisitions. In San Francisco, sales of telecommunications and cable television products rose above an already high level. Cleveland reported that transportation and shipping activity remained very strong in the District, largely due to increased import volumes from East Asia. Unbalanced trade flows to and from East Asia produced an oversupply of empty containers at West Coast ports, while in East Asia new containers were being built to meet the demands of their exporters. In New York, one large retailer stocked up on holiday-season imports earlier than usual due to shipping bottlenecks at West Coast ports. 
Banking and Finance 
Loan demand was steady but strong in most Districts in recent weeks. However, the composition of loan demand differed among regions. Growth in loan demand in Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco was broad-based. In Philadelphia, commercial and industrial lending was flat, while consumer lending rose slightly. In Dallas, demand for home and auto loans increased, while in Richmond demand for home mortgage and commercial construction loans increased. 
Overall, Districts characterized financial markets as intensely competitive, with quality borrowers receiving good terms and rates. Most Districts reported no signs of deteriorating credit quality. Cleveland, Dallas, and New York reported that loan delinquencies and writeoffs fell in recent weeks. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed across the Districts. Reports from Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis highlighted generally good agricultural conditions in their regions, as favorable weather put many crops at or ahead of schedule. In the South, unseasonably hot, dry conditions distressed crops, in many cases destroying fields that could not be irrigated. These drought-like conditions also have damaged range and pasture lands. 
In other Districts, reports focused on prices rather than weather. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported that low prices have reduced profitability among agricultural producers. Price declines for some commodities have been so large that producers cannot cover costs. In addition, many storage facilities remain stocked with the 1997 crops, thereby producing higher storage costs for farmers as they seek alternative facilities. 
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices 
vi 
All Districts reported that labor markets remained tight in recent weeks. Labor shortages were broad-based, and some skilled workers were in especially short supply. Most areas noted problems finding information technology workers and construction tradesmen, such as framers. In addition, a number of Districts noted shortages of quality entry-level workers for retail positions; certain skilled workers such as machinists and welders; finance and banking personnel; and drivers for both short- and long-haul delivery. However, general wage increases remained limited, as employers chose to use one-time payments and merit increases to attract and retain specific types of employees. 
Goods prices remained stable during the recent survey period, although there were scattered reports of increases in some services. In general, declining input prices and intense competition were credited with keeping retail prices in check. Manufacturers and retailers reportedly cannot sustain price increases in the current competitive environment.",0,0
1998-07-31,"Overall, the U. S. economy continues its excellent performance. Output and employment are high while inflation is low. The economy continues to grow in all Federal Reserve districts and across most sectors. The pace of growth has varied across Federal Reserve districts, ranging from quite strong in the Northeast, much of the Midwest and the West Coast, to somewhat more modest growth in the Southeast and in the Dallas district. Growth is fueled by liberal consumer spending and by business investment in plants and equipment. The construction sector is very strong. Manufacturing is robust in several districts, notably Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City, but somewhat weaker in an arc from Dallas through Atlanta and Richmond. 
In agriculture, crop conditions are generally favorable, but crop and livestock prices are low. Oil and gas drilling continues slack, while output in other natural resource industries is generally stable. Seven districts report some adverse effects from economic problems in Asia. 
Household spending The strength of the nation's economy is reflected in household spending. Boston reports 5 percent to 8 percent growth over year-earlier retail sales, while New York and Chicago describe them as above-plan or above expectations. Philadelphia and Richmond describe sales as healthy, Minneapolis as brisk, Kansas City and San Francisco as robust and Dallas as strong. Atlanta sees somewhat softer consumer spending, with most retailers saying ""recent sales had gone as planned, but a significant minority noted their disappointment."" In the Chicago district spending increased modestly, with sales exceeding retailers' expectations, while for St. Louis average sales are up 2 percent to 2.5 percent. 
The composition of consumer spending varies somewhat by region. Home furnishings and related goods are strong in several districts. Summer clothing and other

Federal Reserve and is not a comment on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
apparel are strong in the Midwest, but mixed in New York. Motor vehicles are selling well in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City and Chicago, but more slowly for Dallas and in rural parts of the Minneapolis district. St. Louis was one of several districts to note the effects of strong incentive programs on auto sales. Sport utility and luxury vehicles continue to sell more strongly than other models in many areas. 
Tourism is strong in Boston, New York City and the Carolinas. Atlanta expects a very good season in Florida and notes record business at Mississippi casinos. Minneapolis district tourist businesses also anticipate a good summer season. San Francisco reports good tourist trade at present but anticipates some falling off in October. 
Construction and real estate 
Construction is an engine of growth in many districts. Boston, New York, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City and Dallas all report vigorous home building. Cleveland notes a continued overall strong sector, with residential building up across its district but mixed 
activity in nonresidential categories. Home building is very strong in California, but softer in Oregon and Utah. Chicago's construction sector is bolstered by strong commercial building activity. 
Several districts report strong market activity for existing real estate, both residential and commercial. Richmond relates that residential and commercial business was strong, but the pace of growth was moderating. Minneapolis notes that long waits for newly constructed homes are fueling interest in existing housing. Chicago and New York report tighter markets for office space in contrast to some softening in Philadelphia. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing generally is growing strongly, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest but at a somewhat slower pace elsewhere. Chicago describes particularly robust 
manufacturing, especially in heavy equipment, appliances and steel. St. Louis reports vigorous activity, while Boston lists double-digit sales gains for aircraft components, power equipment, and medical and pharmaceutical equipment. Philadelphia notes 
continued gains, and Kansas City says plants are operating at a high level of capacity. Minneapolis describes manufacturing growth as strong but not spectacular. Cleveland 
says that production is expanding at a slower pace than earlier in the year. In contrast, manufacturing growth appears somewhat slower across the Southeast and 
South. Richmond says that shipments have declined recently and new orders are more modest. For Atlanta, production has increased but expectations reportedly are for some softening. Dallas similarly reports a slightly slower manufacturing sector, driven in part by sluggishness in the energy industry. But demand for construction-related goods in the Dallas district is so strong that items such as drywall and concrete are being rationed by suppliers. San Francisco notes expanded output overall, but deceleration for some products, particularly those affected by slack demand in Asia. 
Agriculture 
Conditions for farmers vary widely depending on region and crop or livestock enterprise. Crop conditions are good in most areas, especially the corn and soybean areas ofthe Chicago, St. Louis and Minneapolis districts. Kansas City anticipates excellent winter wheat yields on a somewhat reduced acreage from a year earlier. Richmond also anticipates good yields for its grain producers. Exceptions to this general pattern are wheat growing areas of Montana and the Dakotas, where drought is a concern as it is for some Dallas district farmers. Cleveland notes mold problems for Kentucky tobacco growers as well as a short wheat crop there. Moreover cold, wet weather has hampered some fruit production in California and the Carolinas. Crop prices remain depressed in response to anticipated strong yields and weak export demand. 
Low cattle and hog prices are putting pressure on producers' bottom lines, although Chicago notes some recent improvement in hog prices from lows experienced earlier in 
the year. San Francisco and Kansas City report that cattle feeders are losing money. 
Other natural resource industries All districts reporting on oil and gas drilling describe it as slack. Dallas notes further slowing of drilling due to large stocks of gas and oil. The energy sector is also weak in the Minneapolis district, with gas somewhat better than oil. Kansas City reports a slight uptick, though activity remains well below year-earlier levels. 
Iron mining sources in the Minneapolis district indicate that 1998 output should match the strong pace set in 1997. Forest product output apparently is stable. Paper manufacturing reports are mixed, with Minneapolis describing profitability varying among grades of paper and Dallas noting increased pulp imports. For Atlanta, mills are still operating below capacity, but with some improvement. 
Banking and insurance Banks and other financial firms are generally in good shape. San Francisco reports stronger demand for loans by businesses than by consumers. Dallas sees increased consumer borrowing, except for auto loans. Kansas City describes higher lending to consumers and agriculture. Minneapolis says that while loan volumes continue to grow, the growth rate has slowed somewhat, and lenders are becoming somewhat more cautious. Bankers in the St. Louis district reportedly describe loan demand and competition as strong. Lending to consumers and businesses in the Chicago district is apparently very brisk, and loan quality may be improving. Banks' loan business is also strong in Richmond, Philadelphia and New York. Boston describes slack demand for traditional life insurance, but increasing interest in lines such as group disability policies as employers increase employee benefits. 
Employment, wages and prices Employment levels are high and labor markets tight in most areas. While no district reports widespread increases in general wage levels, reports of increases in occupation- specific, targeted or nonwage compensation are frequent. Boston, Atlanta, Cleveland and Chicago cite acute shortages of information technology workers and say that some jobs 
are going unfilled. Boston notes that tight labor markets are not yet leading to sizable wage hikes but says that temporary employment firms are expanding sharply. Cleveland reports some acceleration in compensation costs amid indications oftight labor markets. Richmond says that demand for workers remains intense but overall wage pressures are still mild. Similarly, Atlanta describes labor shortages as plaguing parts of its district, but with little upward wage pressures. Chicago sees signs of broad-based labor shortages, with wages rising in specific occupations and at the lower end of the pay scale, but reports that general wage pressures are still subdued. Demand for labor remains strong in the St. Louis district, with some upward pressure on wages noted. Minneapolis continues to have very tight labor markets with widespread nonwage compensation increases despite overall restraint of base wage increases. Kansas City reports continued, but not increasing, moderate wage pressures in very tight labor markets. Dallas made note of firms' widespread difficulty in hiring skilled workers and their use of targeted wage increases. Construction workers are in short supply in the San Francisco Bay area, though there is some easing of employment among high-tech manufacturers. 
Despite indications of tight labor markets in all districts and higher compensation costs in several, prices of goods are largely stable. Boston and New York report 
manufacturing input costs as flat or down. New York purchasing managers see upward pressure on contracted services, with most firms reporting unchanged input and output prices. Cleveland and Atlanta note largely stable commodity, input and finished goods prices. Minneapolis says that commodity and energy prices are holding down increases in the general price level. Price changes are mixed in the Dallas district, with the preponderance lower. San Francisco cites some cost increases for services. 
Inventories 
Reports that mention inventories generally describe them as at normal levels relative to sales. Philadelphia reports stable manufacturing order backlogs and inventories and retailers' inventories at appropriate levels. Cleveland describes some upward movement in 
inventory levels but categorizes them as in line with production levels. Atlanta views inventories as generally on target, while Chicago says retail inventories are ""in good shape."" St. Louis and Kansas City say that most retailers are managing inventories at lower levels, although some auto dealers have too many cars on hand. Minneapolis notes some evidence of shorter delivery times and higher supplier inventories. 
Asia 
Seven districts made specific note of effects from economic problems in Asia. Boston says such troubles have held down some input prices and reduced demand for some manufactures. New York describes incipient price reductions for imported electronics and apparel. Philadelphia lists declining orders from Asia for primary metals and construction materials. Richmond sees more effects from import competition in apparel and textiles than on exports. Chicago steel producers are facing increased competition from Asia and high-tech and electronics is also suffering. Dallas lists weak Asian demand for petrochemicals and telecommunications gear. San Francisco district producers of computer components and lumber also have seen a drop in sales to Asia.",1,0
1998-05-31,"Reports from Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic growth generally continued to be moderate to strong in March and April. Expansion was occurring in nearly all Districts, although Dallas reported some recent signs of slowing growth amid basically strong regional economic conditions and Minneapolis noted some weakening ofbusiness activity in parts of that District. Consumer spending was generally robust in all regions of the country. Manufacturing activity advanced. Real estate markets were generally strong. Agricultural conditions were mixed, as was lending activity. Activity has eased in oil drilling and mining. 
Labor markets continued to be tight. There was some evidence of increased wage pressures in service industries and for computer and technical professionals. Despite increases in labor costs, business contacts indicated that competitive pressures were holding prices in check for most goods. Some increases in service prices were noted, however, in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Consumer Spending 
Retail sales rose generally throughout the country in April. In New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas the strength of the gain exceeded merchants' expectations. Increases were said to be more modest in Philadelphia and Richmond, and retailers in several Districts cautioned that the April results were probably boosted above trend by this year's late Easter.

ii has been selling well in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis. Healthy 
sales of home furnishings, furniture, and appliances were also cited by several Districts. Merchants said store inventories were in line with sales in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City, but some retailers in Richmond said inventories were at higher than desired levels, although they were not increasing. 
In most of the Districts reporting on auto sales, demand has slipped. In Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, sales of cars have softened in recent 
weeks. In contrast, Cleveland and Dallas reported recent increases in motor vehicle sales. Spring tourism was described as very good in Richmond and Atlanta. Reservations for 
summer lodging were strong in coastal areas of the Richmond District, and Atlanta reported that cruise bookings were at an all time high in Miami. But the recently concluded winter tourism season in the Minneapolis District was called disappointing. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity continued to expand. In March and April, strong gains were recorded in Chicago and Minneapolis. Activity grew in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas also reported gains, but the rate of growth in those Districts has slowed from earlier in the year. 
Manufacturing output has increased in a wide variety ofindustries. In particular, construction materials and home-related goods, such as furniture and appliances, were mentioned 
by several Districts. In contrast, output of electronic items was said to be down in Boston and Chicago, and chemical production fell in St. Louis and Dallas. Declining exports to Asia were cited as the main cause ofweakness in these industries. Richmond noted falling exports of 
iii machinery. Increased competition from imports was reported by manufacturers of metals in 
Philadelphia and chemical manufacturers in Cleveland. 
Real Estate and Construction 
All Districts reporting on commercial real estate markets described improvement. For office buildings, rents were rising, vacancy rates were falling, and construction activity was rising. Boston and Richmond reported speculative construction in areas around Boston and the District of Columbia, respectively. New York City office rental costs have increased markedly since the beginning of the year. Besides these Districts, increases in office occupancy and construction were reported from Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and Atlanta. However, Atlanta also noted that vacancy rates in the industrial sector have risen slightly. San Francisco noted increased construction in Alaska for highways and oil-development infrastructure. 
Demand for housing was on the rise in seven of the eight Districts that obtained information on this sector. Home construction was increasing in April in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Sales of new and existing homes were up in Richmond, as were home prices. Real estate contacts in several Districts were wary that recent warm weather has encouraged home buying earlier this year than normal and that sales could slip later. Perhaps as a harbinger of this trend, home sales in Atlanta fell in April after an increase in March. Agriculture 
Agricultural conditions were mixed, as favorable developments for some crops were offset by weakness in livestock markets. The winter wheat crop was said to be in good 
iv condition in the Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts; however, St. Louis noted some 
damage to the peach crop because of freezing conditions earlier this season. Spring field preparation and planting was ahead of schedule in Cleveland, on schedule in Richmond and Dallas, but behind schedule in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City because of wet ground. Wet conditions have also delayed planting of cotton and some other crops in the San Francisco District. 
Low livestock and feed grain prices have seriously impaired farm income in the Minneapolis District, and a fall in hog prices in Kansas City has led to some liquidation of herds. Livestock sales and prices were said to be waning in San Francisco also, although Chicago reported some firming of feed cattle prices in April. Natural Resource Industries 
Oil-drilling activity has declined recently in the three Districts that reported on it: Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Dallas did note, however, that drilling for gas remains active, although below the strong level recorded near the end of last year. Minneapolis noted that mining operations for most minerals have been reduced because of low prices. Financial Services and Credit 
Most of the Districts reporting on loan demand indicated that commercial lending was rising and residential mortgage activity was up, but consumer loan demand had slipped recently. Six Districts were recording increases in bank lending to businesses while one District, Cleveland, said business borrowing was flat. The increases in commercial and industrial loans were posted in Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Mortgage originations, both new and refinancings, were up in all of the Districts that mentioned 
v 
real estate lending: New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco. 
Consumer lending varied. In recent weeks it was up in Atlanta and Chicago, down in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City, and flat in New York and Cleveland. Despite these mixed results, bankers said the quality oftheir institutions' consumer loan portfolios was either steady (in Atlanta) or slightly improved (in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago). Employment and Wages 
Seven Districts obtained assessments of their overall labor markets from business contacts, and in all these, conditions were described as tight. Strong labor demand was noted in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. 
Wage increases in a variety of industries were estimated to be in a range of 2 to 6 percent above last year's levels according to surveys in Boston and Cleveland. Boston noted that computer professionals and engineers were getting wage increases of 8 to 10 percent, and Cleveland reported that temporary help firms were boosting wages by 5 to 20 percent. 
Richmond and Dallas received reports that wage increases were becoming more frequent in service industries, but the increases were not sharp. In Atlanta and Chicago, wage gains were 
said to be more widespread, but the size of the increases was not great. Contacts in St. Louis said upward pressure on wages was growing. Prices 
Information obtained by most Districts suggests that goods prices at most stages of production are nearly steady. Retail prices were steady according to reports obtained by Boston, New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Prices for manufacturing inputs were said to 
vi be steady in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Some increases 
were noted in the Kansas City District, however, along with declines. As already noted, livestock prices were said to be weak in San Francisco and Minneapolis, and Minneapolis reported low prices for natural resource commodities. Oil prices also were reported to be low. One factor apparently keeping goods prices in check is import competition in intermediate and finished consumer products, primarily from Asian countries, as reported to New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas. While the prices ofmost goods are nearly steady, growing construction activity has resulted in some price increases for construction materials, especially lumber. In contrast to the prices of goods, increases in the prices of business services were noted by Dallas and San Francisco.",0,0
1998-04-30,"All district economies continue to show overall strength, but a few have noted some recent moderation in their rates of growth. Retail sales are generally up in most districts, exceeding retailers' expectations in many of them. Auto sales, however, are generally down, although demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles remains high. Industrial activity is on the rise in most parts of the country, with orders and production up. Most districts, though, are experiencing a decline in exports to Asia. Continuing the theme of recent reports, the demand for labor remains strong, with nearly all districts reporting shortages of workers at the entry level and in certain skilled categories. Widespread labor market tightness appears to have increased the degree of wage pressures compared with recent reports. Pressures on product prices remain eerily calm, as domestic competition, productivity gains and the Asian situation help to constrain production costs. Residential housing markets, buoyed by low interest rates and mild weather in many districts, are unseasonably hardy. Commercial real estate markets are healthy across districts. Loan demand, especially for residential mortgages, remains strong in most districts. Agricultural conditions are mixed, with some districts reporting that an abundance of precipitation has harmed crop prospects and delayed field preparation activities. Consumer Spending 
Most districts report that January and February sales are up from one year ago. The Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York and Richmond districts report that sales have generally exceeded retailers' expectations; in the Atlanta and St. Louis districts, sales have generally met expectations. Almost all districts report that unseasonably mild winter weather has

System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii helped boost sales of items in many categories, especially home improvement products, furniture 
and building materials. Sales of winter clothes, however, have suffered in most parts of the country. The New York district notes that contacts experiencing weak retail sales have usually cited mild weather as a cause. The Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Richmond districts report strong sales of spring clothes, particularly for women; the Boston and San Francisco districts note that apparel sales are down. The San Francisco district adds that department store sales in Southern California are also down. Most districts report that retailers' inventories are at desired levels, although some contacts in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts report that inventories are too high. 
Auto sales in most districts are down from one year ago. While sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans remain strong, sales of passenger cars are either flat or down. 
The Richmond district reports, though, that sales of new and used vehicles have exceeded expectations. The Dallas district notes that vehicle sales surged in January, before slowing somewhat in February. Almost all districts report that vehicle inventories are too high, although contacts in the Kansas City district are satisfied with their stocks. Contacts in most districts expect some strengthening in sales this spring. 
Manufacturing 
Almost all districts report steady or increasing growth in industrial activity, although the Dallas district notes a slight weakening in growth. The Chicago district reports that activity is robust, with nearly every sector operating near capacity, while Kansas City district contacts report that current operations are at moderately high levels of capacity utilization and expanding. The Cleveland district notes that, although production is up at most surveyed firms, the number reporting a slowing in production has risen. The Richmond district describes a resurgence of 
iii activity, with sharp rebounds in orders and shipments. The Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, 
New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Francisco districts also report hikes in new orders, while the Kansas City district has seen a mild decline. 
Makers of building materials and related products generally report continued brisk or rebounding sales due to strength in construction markets. The Dallas district, however, notes that sales of construction materials are down because of a wetter than usual February. Aircraft and heavy truck parts, primary and fabricated metals, and steel production are reportedly strong in the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, St. Louis and San Francisco districts. Demand for business services, particularly real estate services, and telecommunications services is up in the Richmond and San Francisco districts. Contacts in the Dallas district, though, report that sales of telecommunications equipment are essentially flat. 
The apparel industry is in decline in almost all districts. Plant closings, falling sales and declining orders are common, reflecting both increased import penetration and a weakening of export demand. Just about every district reports that exports of many goods to Asia are dropping. The Richmond district, however, notes that activity in the district, except in the textiles industry, has not been affected by the Asian situation. The Boston district adds that the strong dollar has been hurting exports to all parts of the world, not just to Asia. Labor Markets 
The tone of this report is largely unchanged from that of recent reports: Taut labor markets continue to hamper business activity in a variety of ways. In general, the apparent imbalance between the demand and available supply of workers remains the dominant theme, with the majority of district reports suggesting that the supply of entry-level and skilled workers-most often in technology-related fields, but also in construction and certain skilled 
iv craft positions-appears to be insufficient to meet existing production schedules. In the St. Louis 
district, for instance, contacts note that UPS is concerned it will not be able to find enough workers to staff a major expansion. 
Firms have used a variety of methods to ameliorate these shortages. For example, in the Boston and Cleveland districts, firms are hiring temporary workers and outsourcing production more often, while in the Atlanta, Chicago and Kansas City districts, firms are resorting to worker training programs and various incentive or award programs. Wages and Prices 
With labor markets stretched to the limit in many areas, there have been reports of rather large wage increases-although this is by no means consistent across all districts. In the Boston district, vigorous demand at temporary employment agencies has produced wage increases of up to 15 percent; wage increases in the retail sector are running 4 to 6 percent higher than the previous year, while wage increases in manufacturing are running at 3 to 5 percent. Wage gains appear to be more measured elsewhere in the country. The Cleveland district reports wage gains of 3 percent, while the Minneapolis and San Francisco districts report wage increases of anywhere from 0 to 4 percent. The Atlanta and Richmond districts report somewhat faster wage growth in the retail sector, but note that overall wage gains are modest to subdued, which is similar to the Chicago and Kansas City district reports. 
Price pressures appear to be less pressing than wage pressures, according to most district reports. Manufacturing raw materials costs have reportedly increased little, if at all, in the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia districts. At the same time, nonmanufacturing firms in the New York district, as well as manufacturing firms in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts, note higher input prices. In addition, a few districts continue to 
V 
report that competitive pressures and productivity gains have worked to offset higher materials prices and to limit product price increases. Although a few firms in the Chicago district have attempted to raise their selling prices, these efforts have not been entirely successful. 
The evolving Asian situation has had some depressing effect on prices, according to most district reports. The Dallas district reports that Asian currency movements against the U.S. dollar 
have caused widespread declines in the prices of commodities, computer components and petrochemical products. In the Atlanta district, some import prices have fallen, although not among importers with fixed contracts. Meanwhile, retailers in the New York district report that no significant price declines in consumer goods have occurred. 
Construction and Real Estate 
Every district reports strong residential housing market conditions. New home construction is described as unseasonably brisk in several districts, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and St. Louis. Mild winter weather, high consumer confidence and low interest rates are credited with much of this strength. However, in several districts, such as Atlanta, Dallas, and Richmond, otherwise robust activity is being hampered by wet weather. Sales of new and existing homes are reportedly strong in most districts, and modest price appreciation is noted by many districts. 
Commercial real estate markets are uniformly described as strong by reporting districts. Contacts in a number of districts are reporting declining vacancy rates, rising rental rates and 
increasing speculative construction. The commercial real estate market has ""picked up dramatically"" in the Richmond district, with ""floods of tenants looking for space."" Nonresidential construction and prices are up in California, while the Dallas district reports a sharp increase in land prices. Contacts in several other districts, however, see signs of an 
vi impending slowdown and are worried about the pace of speculative building. 
Banking and Finance 
Most districts report moderate to vigorous demand for bank loans. Contacts in the Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and San Francisco districts indicate that loan competition, especially on the commercial side, is stiff, although there are concerns in some districts that this competition could compromise credit standards. Mortgage lending, especially refinancings, is reportedly strong in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis districts. Contacts in the Atlanta and Chicago districts report robust consumer loan demand, while contacts in the Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia and St. Louis districts note some softening. A reduction in consumer loan delinquencies is reported in the Chicago and New York districts. The Chicago district notes that credit card repayments are up and personal bankruptcies are declining. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Agricultural conditions vary widely across districts. The deluge of rain that hit California has damaged crops. Near-record precipitation has reportedly worsened the condition 
of the winter wheat crop in the Richmond district rather significantly. In the Kansas City district, however, the winter wheat crop appears to be in good shape. Although rains have delayed field 
activities in the Dallas and Minneapolis districts, overall conditions are reportedly good in those areas. Contacts in the Richmond district are worried that a late frost may harm the apple and 
peach crops. The Chicago district reports that corn exports have weakened markedly-not solely because of Asia-although the soybean export picture is somewhat brighter. In the St. Louis district, cotton exports to Asia, while still expected to wane, are not declining as much as many had expected since sales to other markets, such as Mexico, have picked up. The San Francisco 
vii district reports a similar situation for beef and pork exports. Lower cattle and hog prices are 
hurting the profit margins of producers in the Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City districts. The unseasonably warm winter weather has affected the energy extraction industries to 
varying degrees. The Dallas and Minneapolis districts report increased activity, while energy output increases have begun to decline in the Kansas City district. Solid demand for steel continues to bolster iron ore output in the Minneapolis district.",1,1
1998-02-28,"Federal Reserve Districts reported that as 1997 came to a close the pace of economic growth continued to be moderate. After a slow start in early December, retail sales gathered momentum in the days before Christmas and during the post-holiday weeks. Overall, retail sales for the holiday season were mainly at or slightly above expectations. Motor vehicle sales picked up at yearend due mainly to strong sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans, and light trucks. Manufacturing activity remained fairly strong, although some Districts reported signs of easing. Construction and real estate markets were strong at yearend, with tight markets for office and industrial space in several regions. Some Districts reported evidence of more speculative construction in response to increasing rental rates. Lending activity was brisk throughout the nation despite softer demand for consumer loans. Agriculture reports were generally favorable, although adverse weather has hurt livestock production in some Districts. The impact of Asian financial turmoil was felt in most Districts. Manufacturers and agricultural firms report weaker exports to Asia, and there was some evidence ofincreased competition from Asian products in U.S. markets. Despite lower prices, oil and natural gas drilling activity was strong last month. 
Labor markets remained tight or very tight in all Districts. Reports offirms scaling back production or expansion plans due to labor shortages were more common. Some Districts 
reported increased wage pressures, particularly for retail workers and some skilled occupations. 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected before January 12, 1998. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii According to business respondents, prices were generally flat due to intense competition and 
lower import prices. 
Consumer Spending 
Most Districts reported that retail sales were slow in early December but picked up strongly during the days before Christmas and during post-holiday sale events. With few exceptions, holiday sales met or slightly exceeded expectations. Retailers noted that sales of electronics, computers, appliances, and jewelry were particularly strong. Some merchants reported disappointing sales of winter-related items, such as snow-blowers and winter clothing, due to unseasonably warm weather in many parts ofthe country. Post-holiday inventories were at desired levels. The tourism industry posted strong holiday results, with hotels operating at record high occupancy rates in areas such as New York, Boston, Florida, and California. Ski resorts, however, reported problems due to lack of snow. 
Automobile dealers enjoyed good overall results last month, although sales were mixed across vehicle categories. Sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans, and light trucks remained stronger than sales of passenger cars. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity remained fairly strong, although some Districts showed signs of easing. Boston and Philadelphia reported manufacturing activity improved last month, while New York and Dallas noted weaker performance for the sector. Richmond reported a sharp slowdown in activity. Strong demand, production, shipments, and new orders were reported for aircraft 
iii parts, telecommunication and computer-related products, capital goods, and automobiles. In 
most Districts, the Asian financial turmoil started to have some impact on manufacturing activity. Some Districts reported weaker export demand for industrial equipment, building materials, aircraft parts, semiconductors, processed food, and some metals. There was also some evidence of increased Asian competition in the domestic market. Manufacturers in several regions expressed concern that the Asian turmoil and the overall strength ofthe dollar might hurt sales and profits in 1998. 
Labor availability remained a major concern in most Districts. Manufacturers continued to report difficulties in hiring skilled technical workers, such as engineers. Some contacts in the St. 
Louis District could not meet demand because of a shortage of workers, and a major producer of high-tech equipment in the Chicago District had to cancel some projects because of the shortage 
of engineers. 
Construction and Real Estate 
Construction activity and real estate markets remained strong in most parts of the nation. The only two exceptions were Atlanta and Kansas City. New home sales in the Atlanta District were flat-to-down compared to last December, while construction activity was spotty. In the Kansas City District housing starts were down slightly last month. 
Low and declining vacancy rates for retail, office, and other commercial space in urban areas began to put upward pressure on rental rates. Evidence of some speculative construction was cited by Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas as a response to persistently strong demand for commercial and industrial space. 
iv The housing market remained strong in most regions. Unseasonably warm weather in 
many areas of the country boosted traffic and sales of new homes above their average December levels. Housing markets showed further signs of strength in New York and Dallas and a slight rebound in Chicago. In the Minneapolis District a fast construction pace became the norm. 
Banking and Finance 
Lending activity was brisk in most Districts, led by strong demand for commercial loans and mortgages. New York reported small to medium-sized banks faced softer demand for loans, especially for consumer loans and residential mortgages. Minneapolis reported that demand for bank loans was softening after a very strong 1997. 
Most Districts reported that demand for mortgage refinancing was strong due to falling mortgage rates but that demand for consumer loans remained sluggish. New York, Cleveland, and Dallas noted that loan delinquency rates declined or stabilized at moderate levels. 
Lenders in most Districts reported that strong competition was reducing the spread between borrowing and lending rates, particularly for quality borrowers. In contrast, contacts in Richmond indicated that pricing spreads had been maintained. In general, lending standards were unchanged in most ofthe Districts. 
Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources 
The agriculture reports were generally favorable, although performance was mixed across crops and livestock. Favorable crop conditions were reported by Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and Minneapolis. Winter wheat and small grain crops appeared to be in good shape. Crop 
V 
harvesting was near completion in the Richmond District, and contacts there suggested that yields ofmost crops might fall short of 1996 levels. Chicago noted that farm prices for many key 
Midwest commodities have declined recently, which may hurt farm earnings in 1998. Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported that some agricultural producers were concerned that Asian 
turmoil will lead to weaker farm exports in 1998. In the livestock sector, Kansas City and Minneapolis reported favorable conditions, while 
Dallas reported that snow and cold temperatures hurt some livestock operations. San Francisco also reported herd losses due to unfavorable weather and grazing conditions, particularly in the mountain states. Chicago noted that a seasonal rise in domestic hog marketings and a bulge in hog imports from Canada contributed to a decline in U.S. hog prices. 
Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas reported strong drilling activity for oil and natural gas last month despite weak energy prices. Minneapolis noted that output for iron ore and most forest products may stabilize in 1998 after strong or moderate growth in the last two years. San Francisco reported that a number ofwestern mines had shut down operations due to falling gold prices. 
Labor Markets, Wages and Prices 
All Districts reported that labor markets were tight or very tight last month. Although labor shortages appeared to be broad-based, some skilled workers were in especially short supply. Most areas noted problems in finding computer-related workers, construction skilled tradesmen, and technicians. Shipbuilders in New Orleans were looking to hire foreign welders, shipfitters, electricians, and others. A company in Nashville was forced to idle more 
vi than 10 percent of its equipment due to labor shortages. In the Chicago District some projects 
were canceled due to a lack of labor, while in the St. Louis District some contacts were unable to meet production schedules due to labor problems. Some businesses in the Cleveland District increased their recruiting efforts, resulting in higher demand for human resources personnel. 
Some Districts reported increased wage pressures, especially for some specific industries and skilled occupations. Boston and Richmond reported upward wage pressures in the retail sector. Boston also noted that some manufacturers began offering double-digit pay increases in categories such as engineering. San Francisco reported that wage and salary pressures remained high in financial institutions. Some employers in the Dallas District began offering higher compensation for skilled and semiskilled workers in the service sector and for skilled workers in construction, fabricated metals, bricks and lumber. Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis reported that wage pressures were generally being held in check, with more significant wage pressures confined to specific skilled workers. Most Districts suggested that employers continued to be creative in finding and recruiting additional labor. Some companies were subsidizing transportation for employees located far away from their work sites. Employers in several Districts adopted flexible work schedules and more generous benefit packages. 
While reports of price changes for goods and services were mixed, prices overall remained generally flat. At the retail level, many Districts reported that most of the holiday 
sales occurred late in the season at large discount levels. Richmond reported that prices in the retail, service, and manufacturing sectors grew at a somewhat slower pace than in the last 
vii report, except for soaring prices for starter homes in a specific area of North Carolina. 
Manufacturers in most areas reported stable prices for their inputs and final goods, due to intense competition and lower import prices. Minneapolis noted that manufacturers of intermediate goods continued to receive pressure from customers to lower prices. Tourism appeared to be an exception from the overall price picture, with Boston, New York, and Atlanta reporting higher rates for hotel rooms. Higher rental rates were also reported for commercial and industrial space in many urban areas.",1,1
1997-11-30,"Most District reports characterized early autumn's economic activity as moderate to strong 
in most areas. Retail sales in most Districts in September were weaker than anticipated, with some pickup in October. Automobile sales were mostly slower. Manufacturing activity accelerated or remained at high levels for most Districts, and the outlook was generally positive. Despite the residential real estate markets' recent uneven performance, activity remains at elevated levels overall, and most commercial real estate markets continue to perform at strong levels. The energy extraction sector continues to strengthen. Labor shortages have intensified for key sectors, such as the high-tech and energy extraction industries. Yet, reports of increasing wage pressures are infrequent. Prices remain stable, as competitive factors and resistance from buyers are making it difficult for producers to pass on any cost increases. As harvesting progresses, recent rains have had varying effects on crops nationwide. Commercial lending remained strong in many Districts, 
while consumer lending was more mixed. 
CONSUMER SPENDING 
Most Districts report that retail sales were mixed during September and early October. Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York and Philadelphia said that sales did not meet some retailers' expectations, and sales declined in Philadelphia. Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia merchants said that unseasonably warm weather put a damper on sales in September, 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before October 20, 1997. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii particularly apparel. However, in the Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and New York regions the 
advent of cooler weather in October reportedly has boosted sales. Retail sales growth remains moderate in the San Francisco District despite slow apparel 
sales in parts of the District. In Minneapolis, recent sales have been good with back-to-school sales stronger than normal. 
In the Atlanta District, home-related product sales were strong and, in New York, several retailers noted a resurgence in home goods sales. Appliance sales were said to be strong in both Boston and Cleveland. In Richmond, however, big-ticket items weakened further. In most 
Districts, retail inventories remain at desired levels. Looking toward holiday sales, retailers in Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas are 
optimistic concerning their prospects. Many retailers note their only concern is finding seasonal employees. 
Most Districts reported that automobile sales were down at least slightly. Total automobile sales were down in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Philadelphia Districts, although demand for light trucks and sports utility vehicles remain strong in Kansas City and Philadelphia. TOURISM AND CONVENTION BUSINESS 
Tourism appears to have strengthened from a year ago, according to most reports. Tourism spending has recently picked up in the Minneapolis District. Mild weather has boosted visitors to attractions in the Richmond District. Travel and tourism is strong in California and Utah, although fears of El Nino have caused some cancellations for the winter season. Atlanta reports that in Florida, room rates are up and hoteliers are encouraged by advance bookings. Cruise ship vacation demand out of Florida is up with unusually high levels of bookings. 
MANUFACTURING 
iii 
Manufacturing activity continued to grow in many parts of the country. Plants were operating at high levels relative to capacity in the Kansas City, Chicago, Dallas, and Cleveland Districts. St. Louis and Minnesota report healthy sales by manufacturers. In San Francisco, wood product production and expansions in food processing are occurring in addition to the strong growth in aircraft and high-tech equipment. San Francisco also reports transportation shortages, causing difficulties for production and delivery. Richmond notes that growth in shipments increased in many industrial sectors, and New York reports a broad improvement in the region's manufacturing sector. In the Boston District, makers of aircraft parts and computer-networking equipment are posting rapid growth, and the semiconductor industry is increasing production. In Minneapolis, computer-related producers are also doing particularly well. Production of heavy equipment is accelerating from already high levels in Chicago. Dallas and Atlanta report that demand for oil and gas equipment also remains strong. Increased sales are prompting plant expansions and employment gains in the St Louis region's factory sector. Steel plants are operating at high levels in the Chicago District and the strength is expected to last for the remainder of the year. Atlanta reports that new contracts have spurred shipyards to operate at capacity levels. Atlanta and Boston also note that factory contacts are mostly optimistic that the coming year will see a continuation of current trends in the manufacturing sector. Less positively, 
Minneapolis reports that restructuring continues to result in significant layoffs in their factory sector, and weakness persists in Atlanta's large apparel sector. 
REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION Residential construction and sales have been uneven. Chicago noted a pick up in 
construction and new home sales. An unexpected demand for housing also boosted residential homebuilding in Dallas. In the Richmond District, homebuilding starts have been flat to down recently. Construction is said to be down from last year's levels in Kansas City and St. Louis, while homebuilding is characterized as generally strong in Minneapolis and San Francisco. 
Commercial construction continues to grow. In Boston and Chicago, construction of most types is at higher levels recently. Office markets in Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco continue to tighten. Industrial space is difficult to find in areas of Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. However, in Dallas, new supply is expected to exceed demand by year-end. In Minneapolis, many firms are planning expansions. FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Overall, bank lending was mixed across Districts and loan types. Commercial loan demand increased in many areas of the country. Cleveland, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Atlanta, and Chicago reported that commercial loan demand continued to grow. Consumer lending slowed in Atlanta, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Philadelphia but increased in New York and Richmond. Residential mortgage demand was described as strong in Chicago and Richmond, up slightly in Atlanta, and slowing in Dallas. Mortgage refinancing continued to increase in New 
York and Richmond, while holding at a constant level in Cleveland. Bank credit standards remained steady in Cleveland and increased in Philadelphia and 
Chicago. Some of the slowdown in consumer borrowing has been attributed to the deterioration 
V 
in consumer balance sheets and increased credit restrictions, according to reports from the Atlanta and Philadelphia Districts respectively. 
AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
Good weather helped the harvests in Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco. Recent rains were too late to offset the drought damage to the corn crop but helped soybean, cotton, and peanut yields in Richmond. Rainfall also assisted small grains and winter pastures in Dallas. However, heavy rains have caused concerns about the cotton crop in St. Louis. Harvesting was slowed in San Francisco by shortages of seasonally employed laborers and fierce competition for transportation needed to get harvests from field to market. Scattered instances of rural rail disruptions were reported in Chicago and in the St. Louis District. They have hampered some crop shipments. Oil and gas industry activity is increasing in the energy producing regions of the nation. WAGES AND PRICES 
Many Districts report tight labor markets and hiring difficulties in some occupations, but there are few reports of wage or price pressures. In Dallas, business service firms' revenue growth has slowed because there are not enough workers to meet increasing demand and, in San Francisco, a shortage of skilled workers is beginning to limit activity in some industries. Temporary employment agencies in Cleveland are having trouble meeting demand. Job turnover in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area is reportedly nearing 30 percent. A contact in Chicago notes that some manufacturers are ""desperately short of people,"" especially for entry-level positions, and retailers in that District are already concerned about finding holiday help. A severe shortage of people with technical and computer skills is hurting some companies in the Atlanta District.",1,1
1997-10-31,"Economic activity expanded in July and August in all twelve Federal Reserve Districts. Although some districts note signs of slowing in selected sectors, about half the districts say their region's overall pace picked up in July and August while the others report continued moderate growth. Retail results range from ""mixed"" to growing at a ""solid clip."" Manufacturers report generally rising orders and revenues, with durables manufacturing especially strong. Residential and commercial real estate markets are mostly improving, although the level of new construction activity varies widely. While most energy suppliers are seeing improvements, other natural resource industries and agriculture show considerable variability as a result of weather and other factors. 
Most regions are experiencing tight labor markets, recruiting difficulties, or growing labor shortages. Two-thirds of the districts, however, report that these supply-demand imbalances are not translating into generally higher wages, although wages may be rising faster in selected industries, occupations, firms, or localities. Several districts note that firms are using creative recruiting or compensation techniques to reduce the pressure on wages. With a few exceptions, prices for goods are said to be moving very little, if at all, at the manufacturing level for inputs or finished goods, and at the retail level. CONSUMER SPENDING 
Most districts report that retail sales are growing at a fairly moderate pace. Exceptions are the Minneapolis and San Francisco districts, which report very strong sales growth. Only the Richmond district says that sales growth has slowed, albeit from a brisk to a more moderate pace. Districts

outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii reporting unanticipated increases in sales activity are Chicago and Dallas. In most districts, inventories are at desired levels. However, Chicago reports lower inventories due to a weather-related increase in 
sales, while Richmond reports inventory accumulation as a result of moderating sales growth. Sales of apparel, other back-to-school items, and tourism are said to be very strong in most 
districts. In addition, the St. Louis and San Francisco districts say that sportswear and sporting goods sales are strong, while Boston, New York, and Cleveland cite strength in home furnishing sales. Sales of appliances and other consumer durables are mixed, with almost half the districts (Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco) reporting weak sales results, but New York and Cleveland experiencing strong sales. Although San Francisco reports generally solid retail sales growth in the district, softness is noted in Utah's retail and tourism businesses. 
All districts report tight labor markets and difficulty attracting and keeping retail employees. Nonetheless, most districts say that wages are either holding steady or rising only moderately. Only the 
Richmond district notes sharp wage increases in the retail sector. There is little evidence of price pressures at the retail level; in most districts, both consumer and vendor prices are stable. Only Dallas and New York say that consumer prices are rising, albeit slowly. MANUFACTURING 
Manufacturing activity is reported to be at a high level and rising moderately throughout much of the nation. Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas note that business was accelerating or exceeding expectations. The most restrained commentary comes from Cleveland, where production has moderated but conditions remain ""good or better,"" and Atlanta, which indicates only ""slight"" improvements in manufacturing activity. Most other districts cite steady growth in shipments or orders. 
Durables manufacturers appear to be doing particularly well; districts typically cite strong or accelerating demand for computers and other business equipment, metals, machine tools, aircraft, and heavy equipment. Steel mills, in particular, are said to be struggling to build inventories to meet strong demand from such sectors as construction, oil and gas, and machinery. According to Chicago, light 
iii vehicle production will be higher this quarter than last (in part to rebuild stocks depleted during labor 
stoppages) and order backlogs are increasing for heavy trucks. Several districts indicate growing sales of furniture and lumber, although San Francisco notes that declining foreign demand and rising imports 
had a depressing effect on sales and prices of wood and lumber products in that district. Nondurables manufacturing results are mixed. Oil refineries were operating at record high 
levels of capacity utilization this summer, according to Dallas. However, Atlanta and St. Louis note layoffs in the apparel industry, and Minneapolis and Dallas mention sluggish conditions in food 
processing Several districts report that the United Parcel Service strike created temporary disruptions, and 
rail shipments have been a problem in the Dallas district. Otherwise, there are no indications of unusual delivery lags. 
In general, materials cost pressures are described as modest, although several districts indicate that manufacturers are paying higher prices for metals and packaging. Output prices largely remain in check, with Chicago and San Francisco noting a heightening of competitive pressures as a result of the appreciation in the value of the dollar 
Reports of tight labor markets are widespread, but manufacturers appear to be facing only selective hiring bottlenecks or pay pressures. Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco report stiff competition or accelerating compensation for workers in technical and other specialized occupations. Kansas City manufacturers were also experiencing difficulties hiring production workers. Only Richmond indicates generalized wage acceleration and hiring concerns among manufacturers, while Cleveland exemplifies the other extreme, citing ""no significant labor shortages or wage increases."" REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Most districts report moderate activity in residential real estate markets. A modest increase in sales of existing homes is cited by Boston. New York (upstate only). Richmond. Chicago, Dallas, and 
iv 
San Francisco (in southern California, Oregon, and Washington). However, Boston reports a decline in condominium sales, Chicago a drop in new home sales, and San Francisco a decline in the volume of 
sales in Utah. Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City indicate no notable changes in sales. Home prices remained relatively steady everywhere except for the Twelfth District, where large price increases are 
noted in California, Washington, and Alaska. Excess inventory of existing homes is reported by Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis. 
Commercial real estate markets have been strong in most districts that reported on this activity. Vacancy rates declined in New York, Philadelphia. Atlanta. Dallas, and San Francisco, with particularly strong office markets. Despite the declines in vacancy rates, almost no districts note rising rents. Philadelphia reports a slight increase in rental rates but indicates that new construction could cause them to decrease. Rising commercial construction is reported by Philadelphia. Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas. BANKING AND FINANCE 
Overall lending activity rose in most districts, with slow growth in Richmond and Philadelphia and moderate gains in New York, Dallas, and San Francisco. Among loan types, consumer lending softened in several districts. Commercial loans and home mortgages account for most of the overall increase, although in Atlanta, Cleveland, and Philadelphia commercial lending continued flat or fell slightly. 
Delinquency rates for both commercial and consumer loans continued stable to improved across the country. Several districts report improved asset quality and some tightening in credit standards, although New York and Chicago note some apparent easing of standards for consumer credit and commercial mortgages, respectively. 
A number of districts mention continued strong competition among banks and other institutions, especially for commercial and industrial loans Philadelphia bankers note ongoing competition from commercial finance and specialized small business lenders, while Dallas says that 
V 
stiff competition is exerting pressure on loan rates. San Francisco and Kansas City report a drop in bank deposits, citing strength in equity markets. 
NONFINANCIAL SERVICES 
Temporary employment firms and other service providers continue to expand in all districts, with the exception of Richmond, where service-sector revenue growth eased slightly. Those districts contacting temporary employment or staffing agencies indicate that labor markets tightened further. Many districts report strong competition for highly skilled workers, especially those in computer-related fields. Temporary employment agencies in the Cleveland district describe high demand for clerical and light industrial laborers, and some San Francisco services respondents note a tightening market for entry-level workers. Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, and Richmond report wage increases in the service sector as demand continues to outpace supply. AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
Although recent rains have improved crop conditions in some areas, hot dry weather earlier in the year reportedly reduced the corn, soybean, hay, and fruit crops in parts of the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Chicago districts. However, in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas, where yields have been relatively good, producers are benefiting from favorable corn and soybean prices. Prospects for the cotton crop have improved in St. Louis and are good in Dallas, while the winter wheat harvest is likely to exceed 1996 levels in Cleveland but to be no more than average in Minneapolis. Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all report strong demand and favorable price conditions for poultry and livestock products. Benefiting from good pasture and good prices, Minneapolis and Kansas City ranchers are reportedly building breeding herds or holding calves until the spring of 1998. Contacts also note growing exports of pork and of beef to Mexico and Southeast Asia. 
Reports on the oil sector indicate that continued strong demand for energy products has led to price increases, good profits, and a resurgence in oil and gas exploration activities. In the Minneapolis, 
Kansas City, and Dallas districts, rig counts are at their highest levels in years. While prices remain 
vi below their late 1996 levels, supplies are currently tight: however, seasonal declines in gasoline prices 
are expected soon, and mild weather damped down energy prices in the San Francisco district. Contacts in Atlanta note that the resurgence of the energy sector along the Gulf Coast has produced strong demand for geoscientists and petroleum engineers, while some Dallas contacts believe that a 
shortage of experienced crews may limit future drilling activity.",0,0
1997-08-31,"Overview: Economic activity generally expanded at a moderate rate in many districts in 
June and July, although several reported that growth was more brisk. The tempo of consumer spending picked up since the last Beige Book report, aided in part by improved weather. 
Automobile sales, however, were slightly softer. Manufacturing remained at a high level or expanded further across most industries, particularly for nonautomotive durables. Most districts indicated that manufacturers' inventories remained at generally desirable levels. Commercial real estate activity strengthened across much ofthe country as vacancy rates declined further and rents rose. Home sales and construction increased modestly in recent weeks, but still lagged slightly below year-ago levels. Labor markets tightened further but only scattered wage pressures were noted. Prices for most goods were stable, although reports indicated that lumber and some agricultural prices rose. Recent rains in some districts brought relief to crops damaged by heat and sparse rainfall. Several districts indicated that commercial lending strengthened while reports on consumer lending were more mixed. 
Consumer Spending: Most districts reported stronger retail sales since the last report; only Kansas City had weaker activity. July's sales were noticeably stronger in New York, 
Richmond, and Minneapolis, with descriptions ofsales ranging from ""well above plan"" to ""vigorous."" Philadelphia, Atlanta, and San Francisco, however, reported more modest

Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
improvements. Dallas indicated that consumer expenditures were mixed across that district. Some districts attributed a rebound in sales growth to the arrival ofwarmer weather. 
However, New York stated that increased sales were not limited to seasonal items. Minneapolis reported that sales had increased, in part because some consumers had to replace flood-damaged belongings. Apparel demand appeared stronger in many districts, with Boston, New York, and Chicago citing particular strength in sales of women's fashions. However, Cleveland characterized the demand for children's apparel as soft, and Boston had weak sales of men's clothing. Consumer purchases ofbig-ticket items increased in New York, Richmond, and Chicago. Chicago also noted that sales of some luxury items were up ""noticeably"" from a year ago, particularly of personal watercraft and all-terrain vehicles. In most districts, vehicle sales edged lower; sales of light trucks and sport utility vehicles continued to display considerable strength, but sales of domestic passenger cars softened. 
Retail inventories were in line with sales across most districts. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago reported that retailers' inventories were on target. Kansas City said that retailers there had trimmed inventories and did not believe further reductions were necessary. 
Tourism: Tourism continued to strengthen in much ofthe country. Hotel occupancy rates were generally described as very high. Atlanta noted that the luxury hotel segment continued to post strong growth, and that hotels in Florida enjoyed high occupancy rates despite not offering normal off-season discounts. Philadelphia noted increased business travel and a greater number of summer vacationers. Minneapolis, however, indicated that visits to national 
iii 
parks were ""on the soft side,"" while San Francisco said that vacation traffic was weak in Hawaii but normal elsewhere. 
Manufacturing: Many districts reported that there was further expansion in manufacturing activity. Production picked up in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas districts, and continued at moderately high levels in the Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts. New York reported moderate growth in manufacturing, while Minneapolis noted that growth there was ""solid, but not spectacular."" Atlanta described growth as mixed. 
Production rose for aircraft and related products in the Boston district, but a shortage of skilled labor slowed aircraft production in the San Francisco district. Atlanta noted strength in shipbuilding. Chicago indicated that steel producers and manufacturers ofheavy equipment continued to see increased production and strong orders. In the Cleveland district, however, demand for steel moderated, and in Philadelphia's district, primary metal producers faced slackening demand. Weaker demand for textiles reduced production in the Richmond and 
Philadelphia districts, while continued softness in apparel demand forced further plant closings in the Atlanta district. Furniture manufacturers in the Richmond district reported weaker product demand. The Philadelphia and Dallas districts noted greater demand for construction and building products. 
Few inventory problems were noted. Philadelphia and Kansas City reported that stocks of manufactured goods had been trimmed slightly, and further reductions were anticipated by Kansas City. Inventories in the Cleveland district were only slightly higher than earlier in the year. 
Construction and Real Estate: Residential real estate activity was reported to be higher in some districts, but mixed in others. Chicago noted an increase in sales of existing homes in 
June, but indicated that year-to-date sales continued to lag. Contacts in the Dallas district reported increases in home sales and housing construction, particularly for more affordable homes. Housing starts edged lower in the Kansas City district and were generally unchanged from a year ago. Reports on residential permits were mixed; St. Louis and New York noted increases while Chicago reported that building permits were below those of a year ago. 
Most districts reported strong commercial real estate activity, with declining vacancy rates and vigorous construction. Several districts also reported rising rents, from ""modestly"" in New York, to ""sharply"" in Boston. Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported strong nonresidential construction activity, as did Atlanta, although a lack of suitable land there was slowing industrial development. In the Chicago district, some areas experienced ""record levels of activity,"" and Cleveland reported that ""commercial building improved from the spring."" 
Labor Markets: Labor markets strengthened during June and July. Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported tight labor markets and shortages of skilled workers. Most manufacturers in the Boston district described the pool of available labor as adequate, but Chicago and San Francisco indicated that labor shortages had curbed production in those districts. Finding employees with adequate computer skills prompted some employment agencies in the Cleveland and Richmond districts to offer in-house training. Employees for entry-level and retail positions were increasingly difficult to find and retain in the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts. 
Despite the persistent labor market tightness, wage pressures remained generally subdued. Exceptions included Richmond, where retail wages surged in July, and Chicago and Kansas City, 
with intensifying wage pressures for low-paying, entry-level, and clerical positions. Minneapolis described increased wage pressures accompanied by higher benefits costs. In the Boston district, employers were enhancing compensation packages and offering up-front bonuses to attract job candidates. Dallas reported that more employers were offering nonpecuniary forms of compensation instead of raising wages. 
Prices: Overall prices were stable, and contacts in many areas attributed their inability to raise prices to competitive pressures. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and 
Kansas City generally reported that prices remained steady; Cleveland saw only modest increases. Minneapolis noted that product prices for intermediate and final goods remained ""quiescent."" 
Several districts did refer to price movements in agriculture and energy. Minneapolis reported higher hay, cattle, and hog prices, and Dallas noted that lumber prices were up. Minneapolis, 
Kansas City, and Dallas indicated that gasoline and crude oil prices were falling, and Kansas City noted lower wheat and fed cattle prices as well. San Francisco reported downward price pressure on meat and produce in grocery stores, although cattle prices there had ""firmed further."" 
Agriculture and Natural Resources: Generally, crop conditions appeared to be in good shape, although warm, dry weather hampered crop development in several districts. Cleveland, 
Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported that below normal rainfall caused some deterioration in crops. Recent rains, however, brought relief to farmers in the Richmond 
and Chicago districts. Chicago noted that the rains came at a critical time for pollination, and 
Richmond suggested that while it may be too late for some crops, the rains would prove beneficial on balance. Elsewhere, dry weather helped crop development in Texas and promoted fruit and nut yields in California. 
Livestock remained in good condition, and beef and hog producers enjoyed higher prices. Kansas City reported that many producers were marketing cattle early to head off further price 
declines, and that hog producers were expanding their operations. In Minneapolis, output from beef and hog producers was steady. 
Energy activity continued to improve, with Minneapolis stating that, because of new rigs coming on line, oil and gas exploration in that district was at its highest level in more than a decade. Kansas City reported that the rig count was well above a year ago, while Dallas noted that the rig count there had leveled off. 
San Francisco indicated that logging operations continued to expand at a ""good clip."" In sharp contrast, Minneapolis reported a noticeable decrease in Montana's production of forest 
products. Iron and steel production in that district also showed signs of falling off, but this was attributed to structural changes rather than weaker demand. 
Banking and Finance: Overall lending activity was mixed across districts. Commercial lending increased in several areas of the country. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago reported that commercial loan demand remained strong. Consumer lending was higher in Philadelphia and Cleveland, flat in Chicago, and down in the St. Louis district. Both Philadelphia and Chicago noted some increases in home equity lending. Residential mortgage demand was 
vii 
described as higher in the Richmond district, stable in the New York district, and relatively flat in the Atlanta district. 
Delinquency rates fell somewhat in several districts. New York and Philadelphia reported that delinquency rates continued to decline for most types of loans. Delinquencies remained low in the Dallas district, especially in consumer lending. However, Cleveland reported a slight increase in consumer delinquencies. Cleveland and Kansas City reported tightening of credit standards, as some bankers cited concerns over credit quality.",1,0
1997-07-31,"All twelve district economies expanded in May and early June, although there were pockets of weakness and evidence of capacity constraints restraining growth in some industries. Consumer spending growth was weaker than reported in the last Beige Book, with several districts reporting slower growth in retail and auto sales. Manufacturing activity appeared to remain at high levels and was growing in many districts, but there were some areas of weakening. Construction and real estate markets were strong across much of the country, but some districts reported pockets of weak growth. Overall lending activity was mixed, with stronger demand for commercial than for consumer loans. Labor markets tightened, leading to some wage increases. Although energy prices and some real estate prices were up, there were few reports of other price increases, and business contacts suggested that robust competition restrained upward pressure on final prices of goods. Agricultural reports were generally favorable, but cool weather and adverse moisture conditions hindered production in parts of the country. Consumer Spending 
Many districts reported weaker retail sales growth in May than in April. Unseasonably cool weather in the Cleveland, Chicago, New York, Richmond and St. Louis districts dampened sales growth. Sales were ""weak"" in the Atlanta district, and growth ""downshifted"" in the Dallas district. However, sales growth was ""steady"" in the Boston and Philadelphia districts, ""adequate"" in the San Francisco district, had ""edged up"" in the Kansas City district,

ii and was ""brisk"" in the Minneapolis district. Sales were lower than anticipated in the Atlanta, 
Dallas and New York districts, but sales growth either met or exceeded retailers' expectations in the St. Louis district. 
Many districts reported slow sales of seasonal goods, such as air conditioners, swimwear, and lawn and garden supplies. The Cleveland district reported a dip in personal 
computer sales following strong sales in April. Apparel sales ""have been notably soft"" in the Cleveland district, with the exception of specialty clothing, such as better sportswear and business casuals. Apparel sales have been good in the Chicago and New York districts, however, and the Philadelphia district reported gains in men's clothing and home furnishings. Outdoor furniture and gardening products were the ""biggest sellers"" in the St. Louis district. 
Inventories were in line with sales in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia, San Francisco and St. Louis districts, but excess inventory was a problem for some retailers in the Cleveland, Dallas, New York and Richmond districts. Dallas and Chicago district contacts canceled purchases to keep inventories in line. Some New York district contacts expressed mild concern about an overhang of summer merchandise, but said inventories were ""generally in good shape."" While retailers in the Cleveland district were generally satisfied with inventory, a few noted slightly higher than desired apparel inventories. 
The Cleveland, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Francisco districts reported slow auto sales growth. Sales were ""little changed"" in the Kansas City district, and the Dallas district reported good sales ""in most major cities but a continued trend down in Dallas and Fort Worth."" Auto sales in Minneapolis were ""brisk."" Manufacturing 
Most districts reported growth in manufacturing activity, and a few reported a very 
iii high level of activity. Manufacturing production was at ""high levels"" in the Cleveland and 
Kansas City districts, while ""tightening capacity constraints were noted by various respondents"" in the San Francisco district. Overall shipments remained at ""record levels"" in the Richmond district. Manufacturing activity also continued to expand in the Chicago, Dallas, New York and Philadelphia districts. Sales growth was reported as ""moderate"" in the St. Louis district, and firms continued to report ""good sales"" in the Minneapolis district. The Boston district reported that recent business was ""flat or up at a single-digit rate compared to a year ago."" Only the Atlanta district reported ""production is slowing overall."" 
Production was up for aircraft and related products in the San Francisco district, while the pace of new orders quickened for paper goods, textiles and apparel in the Richmond and Dallas districts. Orders also were up for electrical equipment and industrial machinery in the Richmond district. Plant expansions are under way in the electronics, telecommunications and chemical industries in the Atlanta district. The Atlanta and Dallas districts reported strong demand for equipment by the energy sector. The Dallas and St. Louis districts noted a pickup in sales of construction-related manufactured products, although Dallas noted that sales were below last year's ""gangbuster"" levels. 
Strong demand for steel and heavy equipment led to a pickup in production in the Chicago district, and steel producers reported capacity utilization remained very high. But the Philadelphia district noted ""some slippage in demand"" by primary metal and instrument producers, and the Cleveland district reported ""some flattening in steel orders, although production is steady at a high level."" In the San Francisco district, demand for machine tools grew but at a slower rate than earlier, with growth focused on the export market. 
High-tech manufacturers in the Dallas and San Francisco districts reported supply 
iv constraints for some computer components and slower demand growth for telecommunications 
products. The Richmond district reported weaker shipments by the apparel, furniture and printing industries. There was continued weakness for soft goods in the Atlanta district, while 
the Minneapolis district reported that output of packaging materials was weak. Some inventory problems were noted. One automaker in the Chicago district said weak 
sales had resulted in a sizable inventory buildup, while the Dallas district reported inventories of brick and cement were too high. Manufacturers have been trimming their inventories in the Kansas City district, and some say they plan further reductions because stocks exceed desired levels. In the Chicago district, inventory-to-sales ratios declined despite some inventory building. During the past month, order backlogs inched up for manufacturers in the Philadelphia district, and delivery times lengthened slightly and inventories edged down. Services 
Temporary-employment firms and other service providers continued to report strong activity in the Boston, Dallas, Richmond and San Francisco districts. Tourism activity was strong in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond and San Francisco districts. Construction and Real Estate 
Real estate markets and construction activity ""remained strong"" in most areas of the San Francisco district, while ""strong residential and heavy construction"" was reported in the 
Minneapolis district. Construction activity remained very strong in the Chicago district, ""particularly in nonresidential segments."" 
Several districts reported increasing commercial real estate activity but slower growth in home sales than at this time last year. Residential real estate ""continued its strong course"" in the Boston district, although ""somewhat less so than earlier."" The Chicago, Cleveland, 
V 
Kansas City and Philadelphia districts reported that home sales had slowed since the beginning of the year. Home sales and construction ""flattened"" in the Atlanta district. Banking and Finance 
Overall loan quality was ""generally holding steady"" in the Atlanta district and ""good"" in the Chicago district, with little change in credit standards. A few banks tightened their lending standards in the Kansas City district, citing concerns over credit quality. Contacts expressed concern about an oversupply of loanable funds in the Dallas district, but delinquency rates had not increased. 
The Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, San Francisco and St. Louis districts reported stiff competition for borrowers, particularly for commercial loans. Competition encouraged lower interest rates and a relaxing of credit requirements in the Chicago, Dallas and St. Louis districts and ""ongoing efficiency-driven consolidation"" in the San Francisco district. 
Consumer lending was up in the Atlanta and Philadelphia districts, but was reported to be flat in the Richmond district, and have softened somewhat in the Cleveland and St. Louis districts. The Chicago district reported slower credit card usage but continued high delinquencies. Credit card loan charge-offs continued to rise in the Philadelphia district. The Cleveland and New York districts reported tighter standards on consumer loans and a decline in delinquencies, but in the Cleveland district ""several bankers continue to note a rise in bankruptcies."" Labor Markets 
Labor markets tightened in the Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Richmond and San Francisco districts. Continuing labor shortages were reported in the Atlanta, Boston, Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts. Tight labor markets were still reported for skilled 
vi professionals in the high-tech, construction and energy industries. The Atlanta, Chicago, 
Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts noted greater difficulties finding skilled blue-collar and entry-level workers. 
Most districts reported little or no wage pressure or noted that pressures were confined to a few markets. At some temporary-employment firms in the Cleveland district, however, the growing number of marginally qualified workers has translated into higher training and screening costs. The pressure to raise wages increased in the Dallas, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts. The Minneapolis district reported ""a continuing move to extend benefits to groups of workers previously not covered. One Wisconsin contractor reportedly paid full wages to an idle crew for three weeks between jobs, just to avoid losing them to competitors."" In the St. Louis district, ""Some firms are unable to meet higher demand because they are understaffed."" Prices 
Prices for energy and for some metals and real estate rose, but few districts reported upward pressure on final goods prices. Several districts suggested that retail and manufacturing prices were being held in check by heavy competition, which was stimulating continued cost reduction or productivity increases. 
The Dallas district reported higher prices for oil, gasoline, natural gas and heating oil. Most steel producers in the Chicago district were successful in pushing through moderate price 
increases recently. Scrap metal prices were down in the Dallas district, although there was some feeling that this was a result of customers' building too much inventory, and therefore only temporary. In the San Francisco district, the metal industry reported aluminum mill operations at 90-95 percent capacity, with prices escalating for certain materials in short 
vii supply. The Dallas and Minneapolis districts reported higher chemicals and plastics prices. 
Philadelphia reported scattered rising input prices, mainly in the nondurable goods sectors. A few districts noted higher housing, construction or land prices. Housing prices were 
up in the Boston district, and there were sharp rises in New York City co-op and condo prices and hotel rates. Office rents were up 20 percent over year-earlier levels in the Dallas district, and land prices were rising for industrial and office locations. The Kansas City and San Francisco districts reported increasing construction costs. The Cleveland and Chicago districts reported strong increases in farmland values. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Excess moisture in the Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts slowed fieldwork and led to some replanting, while dry conditions slowed planting activity and crop development in the Chicago and Richmond districts. Planting and growth of crops were also hampered by cool weather in the Chicago, Richmond and St. Louis districts. Several districts reported improving livestock and pasture conditions, and growing demand for cattle and lower grain prices. The San Francisco district reported weak demand for the Idaho potato. 
The Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts reported that energy industry activity was strong or improving. Dallas reported that, at current energy prices, cash flow is strong at oil service companies and the return on investment is ""phenomenal,"" creating a rush to get wells drilled. Bottlenecks continued to be created, however, by shortages of key personnel, such as machinists, engineers, ship captains and crews, as well as of drill pipe and many types of equipment. The Minneapolis district reported that iron mining production was strong, and forest production was ""steady.""",0,1
1997-05-31,"District economies generally continued to expand at a moderate rate through March and April. Most districts indicated that retail sales were above year-ago levels. Light vehicle sales tapered off from very high March levels in most of the nation. The housing and construction industries remained strong, with commercial construction outpacing residential in most districts. Manufacturers were operating at very high levels, with new orders increasing significantly in some areas. Labor markets remained tight in most districts, with a few new reports of upward wage pressures. Virtually all districts were reporting relatively flat retail prices, while reports were mixed for raw and intermediate goods. Most districts reported a pickup in business lending activity, with some reporting fierce competition and credit standards being lowered to attract business loans. At the same time, demand was mixed for mortgage and consumer loans and a few districts were reporting tightened credit card standards. Agricultural conditions were mixed, with some reports noting above-average crop progress and improving livestock conditions. But adverse weather delayed or damaged crops in other districts and caused heavy livestock death losses and flood losses in the Minneapolis district. Energy prices continued to drop in most regions, but production in the industry remained strong. Consumer Spending 
Most districts reported a moderate year-over-year increase in retail sales. Only the Boston and Richmond districts, which noted strong growth, and the New York district, which

ii reported considerable slowing, differed markedly from this pattern. Apparel sales were strong in 
the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago districts, while Philadelphia was the lone district reporting weak apparel sales. The Boston and New York districts reported 
particular strength in sales of building materials. The demand for electronics improved slightly in the Chicago district but remained soft there and in most other regions. Appliance sales were 
also soft in the Boston, New York, and Atlanta districts but were improving in the Cleveland district. Inclement weather hindered the sale of some spring merchandise (sporting goods, lawn and garden equipment, etc.) in the Chicago district. Overall retail inventories were in line with sales and/or merchants' expectations in most districts. Strength in tourism spending was noted in the Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta districts and most of the San Francisco district, where the strengthening dollar was cited as contributing to a decline in Hawaii's tourist trade. The Minneapolis district indicated that severe weather was adversely affecting their tourist trade. 
April vehicle sales softened in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis districts after strong results in March. Automobile dealers in the Kansas City district reported a 
slight increase in sales, with notable strength in light trucks and sport utility vehicles. The Dallas district reported an auto sales rebound in April, but sales for the month still fell short of last year's results. The Chicago district reported that scattered strikes were limiting the availability of some of the automakers' most popular models. 
Housing/construction 
New home construction was reportedly strong in most of the nation, but down slightly from last year's very high levels. The Chicago and Kansas City districts experienced a pickup in new home sales from earlier in the year but did not reach last year's levels. The Cleveland and New York districts described new housing activity as improved. The New York district also 
iii reported that remodeling activity was booming. Particular strength was noted in multifamily 
construction by the Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas districts, while the Atlanta district reported softening in this segment of the market. Existing home sales were mixed across much of the nation. The Richmond district said the market for existing homes was ""brisk,"" while the Minneapolis district reported softening from ""exceptional strength"" earlier in the year. 
Commercial real estate remained very strong through most of the nation. Declining office vacancy rates and increasing rents were reported by most districts. Leasing activity was described as ""torrid"" by the New York district. The Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts all reported an increase in office construction. The Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco districts were reporting strong industrial activity. Manufacturing 
Overall manufacturing activity increased across much of the nation despite scattered auto-related strikes which were affecting several districts. Industrial activity reportedly increased in all but the New York and Dallas districts. The Dallas district noted weakness in paper, box, and most construction-related products. The Boston district reported ""solid"" year- over-year gains due in part to strength in biotech instruments and computer networking equipment as well as a recovery in the aerospace industry. Expansion in the aerospace industry also contributed to manufacturing strength in the Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts. Strength in the steel industry was cited in the Cleveland and Chicago district reports. Demand 
for capital equipment was strong in the Cleveland and Richmond districts. Apparel and garment production strengthened in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Richmond districts but fell off in the Atlanta and St. Louis districts. Strong sales boosted light vehicle production earlier in the year, but recent strikes against automakers and their suppliers idled plants in several regions, most 
iv 
notably the Chicago and St. Louis districts. However, contacts in the Chicago district had yet to feel any significant impact from these strikes. 
Surveys indicated broad-based gains in new orders in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Philadelphia districts, while new orders in the Richmond district ""surged."" Contacts in the St. Louis district indicated that demand for their manufactured goods had increased and a contact in the Minneapolis district reported ""We have plenty of new orders."" One-quarter of the Boston district's manufacturing contacts indicated that they were facing capacity constraints, but slight declines in order backlogs and delivery times in the Philadelphia district suggested that ""demand was not pushing against capacity limits."" Banking/finance 
Overall lending activity was decidedly split, with most of the strength on the business side and most of the weakness on the consumer side. The Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts all reported increases in business lending. The Cleveland and Richmond districts noted that business lending was mixed. None of the twelve districts reported an outright decrease in business lending during this reporting period. Fierce competition for business customers was cited in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco reports. Credit standards for commercial loans were reportedly lowered in the Chicago and San Francisco districts and more favorable loan arrangements were noted in the Richmond district. 
On the consumer side, only the Kansas City district was reporting an increase in overall lending activity, albeit slightly. Most districts were indicating flat or decreasing activity. Mortgage lending had declined noticeably in the Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis districts and had become ""spotty"" in the Chicago district. The New York and Kansas City districts were reporting increased mortgage lending activity. Consumer credit standards were being tightened 
V 
in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas districts. Two districts, New York and Cleveland, reported slight improvement in consumer delinquency rates while a contact in the Chicago district noted an increase in store credit card delinquencies following a period of flattening 
earlier in the year. However, overall bank asset quality and/or loan quality was reported to be good in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago districts. Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices 
Tight labor markets and shortages of qualified help persisted throughout much of the nation in March and April. Two districts, New York and Chicago, reported further tightening, 
while the St. Louis district noted fewer reports of tight labor markets. Labor shortages existed in each district, with computer-related and other highly skilled workers cited most often. Employment growth lagged the nation in the Cleveland and Chicago districts, though the latter noted an increase in manufacturing employment recently after trending downward in 1996. 
Despite tight labor markets, upward wage pressures remained generally subdued. The notable exceptions are those areas and occupations where serious shortages existed. In addition, the Minneapolis district noted new reports of upward pressure on manufacturing wages. Increased turnover rates were reported by the Boston, Cleveland, and Atlanta districts. Increased use of bonuses to attract workers was reported in the Dallas and Cleveland districts. 
Prices for raw materials were reportedly flat to down in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis districts. In addition, declining energy prices were noted in the Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts. Contacts in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts reported increases in some raw material prices and only the St. Louis district cited an increase in energy prices. Costs of construction materials--especially lumber, drywall, and concrete--increased sharply in the Richmond district. Significant resistance 
vi to price increases persisted in most districts. Consequently, most districts reported that prices at 
the retail level remained subdued. There were exceptions, however. Continued strong demand enabled many retailers in the Boston district to increase their prices and contacts in the Chicago district reported a reduction in the use of discounting to move inventory. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
The agricultural reports were mixed. Above-average progress in crop plantings was indicated in reports from the San Francisco, Richmond, and Chicago districts, while the St. 
Louis, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts noted delays in plantings and/or crop development. A late freeze damaged fruits and vegetables in the St. Louis and Richmond districts and wheat in the Kansas City district. 
An early April blizzard added to the high winter death losses of cattle in the Dakotas. By contrast, improved market conditions ended the culling of most cattle herds in the Kansas City district and started a rebuilding of herds in the Dallas district. Hog numbers were reported to be growing considerably in some areas of the Richmond district, while the Chicago district noted that tougher environmental restrictions on larger producers were delaying the expected expansion. 
Energy industry activity increased in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts despite continued price decreases. Refinery profit margins were increasing for the Dallas 
district's energy industry since crude prices were falling more rapidly than product prices, and demand was reportedly strong enough to support an additional 10 to 20 drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.",0,1
1997-04-30,"District economies generally continue to expand at a relatively moderate pace. Retail sales are up in most districts from a year ago. Most districts report high levels of manufacturing activity, with only pockets of weakness. Tight labor markets still dominate in almost all parts of the country. Nevertheless, wage gains generally remain moderate. Price pressures, such as those reported by most retail and manufacturing contacts, appear to have been temperate. Most districts report strong residential real estate markets, with many citing increases in year-over-year building permits, increases in new or existing home sales and rising home prices. Commercial real estate markets continue to strengthen, with many districts reporting declining vacancy rates, rising rents and new nonresidential construction activity. Loan demand conditions are decidedly mixed across districts in all major categories of loans-commercial, consumer and real estate. Most districts report that prospects for livestock producers have brightened recently. Despite moderate drops in oil prices, activity has picked up noticeably in the energy extraction industries. Consumer Spending 
Most districts report that January and February sales are up from one year ago. The Atlanta, Boston and New York districts report that sales have exceeded expectations. The San Francisco district describes sales growth as moderate, while the Cleveland district reports retail conditions as essentially unchanged from its previous report. Apparel has been a strong seller in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City and New York districts; however, apparel sales are down in the Boston district and unchanged in the Richmond district. Cosmetics, building materials, pharmaceuticals and home

ii 
furnishings are also strong sellers, according to contacts. The New York district reports that a ""tax- free"" week in New York City spurred sales, but severe winter weather in the Minneapolis and San Francisco districts hampered sales at many local stores. Current inventories are generally at or slightly below desired levels. 
Vehicle sales are mixed across districts. The Kansas City district reports slightly higher auto sales levels, while the Minneapolis district notes strong sales of pickup trucks. Car sales in the Philadelphia district remain unchanged, while the Cleveland and Dallas districts note slower-than- expected sales. Vehicle inventories are generally adequate, although a few reports of shortages of 
popular vehicles have been received. 
Manufacturing 
Most districts report that manufacturing activity remains at a high level and is, in many cases, growing. Pockets of weakness, however, are interlaced with this growth in many districts. The Dallas and Richmond districts report their manufacturing sectors as either ""still in a seasonal lull"" or down slightly. The Minneapolis district, on the other hand, describes its manufacturing sector as ""hale and hearty."" The St. Louis district notes that even though the level of activity has not changed much from the last report, contacts are still optimistic about the near term. 
Auto suppliers in both the Atlanta and Boston districts and heavy-duty truck manufacturers in the Chicago and Cleveland districts report strong business, while the San Francisco district notes that the aircraft and high-technology industries in the Pacific Northwest are expanding. In the Philadelphia district, metal and chemical products are showing recent strength, while furniture and home furnishings producers in the Boston, Chicago and St. Louis districts report that orders are up. Most districts are experiencing an ongoing contraction in the apparel industry, with some of 
iii this production heading overseas. Several districts also note that their paper and textile industries are in decline. The New York district notes a moderate slowing of manufacturing activity in New York City, and the San Francisco district reports that the electronics industry in California has slowed somewhat. Growth in the steel industry is slowing in the Chicago district, while remaining 
strong in the Cleveland district. 
Labor Markets 
Contacts in almost every district report difficulty finding and retaining new workers because of tight labor markets. Shortages of engineers and construction, skilled manufacturing and high-tech workers are most often noted. The Boston and Dallas districts report that temporary employment agencies are also having difficulties finding workers. The San Francisco district reports worker shortages in the hospitality industry, but notes a surplus of financial-sector workers because of consolidation in the banking industry. A survey of manufacturers in the Philadelphia district found that about 40 percent plan to hire employees in the near term, while a survey of businesses in the St. Louis district found that 20 percent are looking to hire. Wages and Prices 
Despite tight labor markets in nearly every district, nominal wage gains show no signs of breaking out of the 3 to 4 percent range that has been cited in the last several reports. Pockets of persistently upward wage gains associated with fast-growing sectors and regions remain, however. In particular, wage pressures remain in the Chicago district but are most pronounced at the upper end of the pay scale, while the Minneapolis and San Francisco districts report sector-specific wage increases tied to the high-technology and aircraft sectors. The Dallas and Kansas City districts, on the other hand, report a lessening ofwage pressures. 
iv Aside from higher raw materials prices reported in a few districts, price increases at retailers 
and manufacturers-both on the input and output side-have generally been temperate, as many districts report that competitive pressures have stemmed price hikes. The Boston, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts report that retail prices are ""mostly flat"" or ""steady."" Moreover, in the Atlanta, Boston and Cleveland districts, wage and input price advances have been offset or negated by increased productivity gains. Materials and finished goods prices have reportedly accelerated in the Atlanta and Richmond districts; however, contacts suggest that these increases may be temporary. 
Construction and Real Estate 
Most districts report strong residential and even stronger commercial real estate markets. Contacts in the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond and San Francisco districts report increases in single-family residential construction. Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis 
districts also report strong residential market conditions. Mild winter weather is credited for some of the strength in the Boston, Philadelphia and Richmond districts, while poor weather is blamed for moderate weakness in the Chicago and Dallas districts. The Atlanta and Kansas City districts report little change in year-over-year construction activity. Sales of new or existing homes are reported to be up in the Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and San Francisco districts. Slight price increases, some due to increases in material prices, are reported in the Boston, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond and San Francisco districts. 
Commercial real estate markets continue to improve in most districts. Declining office vacancy rates and rising rental rates are reported in the Atlanta, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts. New nonresidential construction is reported in the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, 
v 
Richmond and San Francisco districts. Contacts in the Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis districts also describe their commercial real estate markets as strong. Banking and Finance 
Loan demand conditions are decidedly mixed across districts, although more districts report declining or steady loan demand than rising demand. The Dallas district reports little change in overall demand since its last report, and the San Francisco district reports healthy overall demand. Commercial and industrial (C & I) loan demand is reported to be strong in the Chicago district and steady in the Atlanta, Cleveland and Philadelphia districts. The Kansas City, New York, Richmond and St. Louis districts report slight declines in C & I loan demand. A number of districts continue to report low margins and fierce competition among lenders for C & I loans; a contact in the Richmond district characterized margins as ""ridiculously low."" 
Consumer loan demand is reported to be increasing, but at a slower rate, in the Chicago district and mixed or flat in the Atlanta and Cleveland districts. The Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis districts report declines in consumer loan demand. There appears to be no consistent trend in consumer loan quality; the Cleveland and New York districts report rising delinquencies, while the Atlanta and San Francisco districts report improving consumer loan quality. Residential mortgage demand is mixed. The Atlanta, Philadelphia and Richmond districts report increases in residential mortgage demand, while the Kansas City, New York and St. Louis districts report 
decreases. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Other than weather-related cattle deaths in the Minneapolis district, increased profit margins are the rule rather than the exception among livestock producers. For example, the Kansas City 
vi district reports that bankers expect wider margins for cattle and hog producers because of lower feed 
costs. Increased cattle prices have also been noted in the Dallas and Richmond districts, buoying producers. 
In the natural resources industries, the Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts report that their energy extraction industries are experiencing an uptick of economic activity; this has occurred despite modest drops in crude oil prices. The Dallas and Minneapolis districts also report higher lumber prices, which, in Minneapolis at least, have been passed on to builders. 
Weather-related problems have and will likely continue to affect economic activity in many districts. Severe winter weather in the Minneapolis district has reportedly hampered weight gains in the cattle industry. The Minneapolis district also reports a potential for the worst flooding in several decades because of substantial snowpack. Flooding and wind-related damage stemming from severe winter storms in early March have also been reported in the St. Louis district",0,0
1997-02-28,"Economic growth in December and early January was moderate in most parts of the country. Holiday season sales were in line with retailers' expectations of moderate growth. 
Manufacturing activity continued to grow, with significant strength coming from capital equipment and materials manufacturers. Bank loan activity continued at high levels, with mixed growth across Districts; some Districts reported signs of slight deterioration in consumer credit quality. Residential real estate markets remained stable or improved in most areas, and commercial real estate markets were almost uniformly tight. District reports provided scattered evidence of increasing wage pressures, particularly for skilled workers, but in general did not indicate significant price pressures other than for energy items. Consumer Spending 
Holiday sales improved over last year by small to moderate amounts that generally met retailers' expectations. Among Districts providing numerical reports, year-over-year holiday sales growth was 4 to 8 percent in New York, around 5 percent in Philadelphia, 7 percent in St. Louis, and 0 to 2 percent in Minneapolis. Virtually all Districts noted that the strongest sales were in small-ticket items such as apparel and toys; New York and St. Louis reported that jewelry also sold well. In contrast, consumer electronics showed weak year-over-year sales gains, with the 
* Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected before January 13, 1997. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii exception of solid growth for large screen televisions and satellite dishes in Cleveland, non- 
computer electronics in New York, and general electronics in St. Louis. Retail sales of computer equipment in particular were disappointing, according to Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. 
Accurate planning among retailers in general kept inventories on target for most product lines. As a result, price discounting was limited; the exceptions include reports of widespread discounting by retailers in Minnesota and discounting on apparel inBoston. Strong post-holiday sales in the New York and Chicago Districts contributed further to lean inventories in those areas. 
Reports on the automobile market were slightly downbeat. Philadelphia, Kansas City, Dallas, and Minneapolis all reported slow December sales. In the Cleveland District, however, strong sales during the last two weeks ofDecember left dealers optimistic that ""marginally high"" inventories there would return to preferred levels by February. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity held steady or expanded in most areas. The strongest sectors were those that produce steel and other metals, machine tools, construction materials such as lumber, 
and capital equipment for transportation and construction. Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco all reported heightened activity in one or more of these sectors. Automobile and parts production reportedly expanded in Chicago and Atlanta, although Boston reported intense competition among auto suppliers there. In the high-tech sectors, semiconductor firms exhibited signs of recovery from a weak 1996, and computer firm shipments reportedly picked up following weak holiday sales. Both the Dallas and San Francisco Districts benefitted noticeably from these trends, and Minneapolis reported that 
iii electronics manufacturers did well there. On the down side, furniture orders weakened in 
Richmond, and furniture inventories increased in Atlanta. Among nondurable goods sectors, food processing in Minneapolis and poultry processing 
in St. Louis both expanded. However, apparel and textile production was weak in Richmond and Atlanta, as was the market for paper in Richmond and Boston. Petroleum producers benefitted from high prices and were operating at or near maximum capacity in Minneapolis and Dallas, with very low inventories reported by the latter District. 
Nonfinancial Services and Tourism 
The few reports on nonfinancial service activities were mixed. Richmond reported slower growth in service employment, due to declines in business and personal services, and Cleveland reported a decline in temporary employment, perhaps due to seasonal factors. In contrast, San Francisco reported strong growth in demand for telecommunications services. 
Performance in tourist trade varied substantially across regions, due largely to weather considerations. Warm weather reduced downhill skiing business in the Richmond District but did not increase coastal tourism over last year's level. Minneapolis reported that extreme cold and stormy conditions in early January reduced winter sport tourism in the District. San Francisco reported reduced tourism in Northern California and Nevada due to recent flooding. In contrast, Atlanta reported excellent tourist activity, particularly in Florida: theme parks set attendance records there, and Miami was a popular destination. Real Estate and Construction 
Most areas experienced stable or rising demand and active construction, with noticeable strength coming from tight markets for commercial real estate. Atlanta, New York, Richmond, 
iv Chicago, and St. Louis reported strong or rising commercial construction activity. Furthermore, 
Philadelphia and Dallas reported high levels of commercial leasing and sales and low vacancy rates. Boston reported increasing prices for commercial properties in Massachusetts. 
Residential markets appear stable overall, with small improvement reported in some Districts and slight slowing reported inothers. Where slowing occurred, however, building activity generally exceeded year-ago levels. New York and Chicago reported firming conditions in their residential markets. ""Boom"" conditions persisted for residential markets in many portions of the Minneapolis district. Residential housing sales eased somewhat in Richmond, although permits were up there. Kansas City noted some slowing in housing starts and sales, with the latter confirmed by a reported decline in mortgage lending. Within the San Francisco District, real estate markets were strong in most areas; California was the primary exception. Although total building activity in California continued to be weak, home sales and prices rose in some parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, and the Los Angeles area showed signs of improvement following its prolonged housing slump. Banking 
Banks reported active loan markets overall, although with limited growth on average and more strength in commercial loans than in consumer and mortgage loans. Total loan volume grew in Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. In contrast, New York reported declines in all categories, with the sharpest drop inmortgage lending. Richmond reported that commercial loans ""changed little,"" while demand for consumer and mortgage loans declined. Total lending was flat in Atlanta, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Chicago; credit card loans, however, expanded in the latter two districts. 
V 
Loan quality was reported to be good in most areas, except for concerns about consumer credit in some Districts. New York and Kansas City noted higher consumer loan delinquencies, and Cleveland reported rising consumer bankruptcies. Both Cleveland and Richmond described loan competition as ""fierce."" Agriculture 
Reports on the agricultural sector were mixed, with inclement weather clouding the picture in some areas. On the up side, Kansas City reported a good winter wheat crop, and 
Richmond noted that its winter wheat crop was ""on schedule."" Furthermore, Kansas City reported that reinvestment of strong 1996 farm revenues was reflected in higher sales of new farm equipment. On the down side, excessive rain interfered with field work and delayed corn harvesting in Richmond, and flooding damaged some crops in the San Francisco District. A December cold snap hurt vegetable crops in Dallas, although citrus crops were spared. 
Livestock conditions also were mixed. Cattle feeding costs were reduced by warm weather in Richmond but increased by cold weather in Minneapolis. In San Francisco, heavy rains improved grazing conditions for a time, but later flooding necessitated herd movement to less attractive grazing areas. Employment and Wages 
Wage increases were reported to be moderate overall, despite widespread reports of continued wage pressure for various skilled worker groups. Excess demand for skilled 
manufacturing, administrative, or technical workers-particularly computer technicians-was noted by Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco. Richmond reported that ""wage pressures were more evident"" in general, and Chicago identified ""signs of 
vi increasing wage pressures."" Furthermore, labor markets were uniformly tight in Kansas City, St. 
Louis, and Minneapolis. However, no District reported large year-over-year wage increases; reported numerical increases were 2 to 4 percent in Boston, ""less than 4 percent"" in Philadelphia, and 2 to 3-1/p2ercent in Minneapolis. Prices 
Price pressures were moderate overall, with the primary exception ofsharply rising energy costs. The prices of manufacturing raw materials or goods were characterized as stable in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis, and earlier pressure on construction costs in the Chicago District has eased. In Richmond, however, ""price increases were more widely reported"" than earlier, and Dallas noted rising prices for some raw materials and retail products. St. Louis reported that ""recent increases in energy prices are being passed along to customers"" in the transportation industry.",1,1
1996-11-30,"Moderate expansion of business activity characterizes the economy in most Federal Reserve districts, but on balance the pace of growth reportedly has slowed somewhat. Slower growth is reported in the Southwest and along the eastern seaboard except for New England. The Midwest continues to show moderate to strong growth. Boston and San Francisco, two districts which had lagged much of the rest of the nation through the first half of the 1990s, indicate an improved performance. Although there are few indications of significant price increases for raw materials, goods or services, reports of upward pressure on wages are more widespread. 
Consumer spending 
On balance, consumer spending is best characterized as moderate. There are some signs of strength, but no areas where sales are booming. There is considerable variation in patterns of spending both by region and by category of merchandise. Boston describes double-digit growth in furniture and hardware, but slow sales for discounters and a shoe chain. In the New York district, apparel is strongest and durables such as appliances lag. The same pattern is true for Kansas City. Philadelphia describes strong women's and youth clothing sales, but notes that some retailers ascribe this strength to price cuts. Cleveland reports strength in sportswear and major appliances, with weakness in computers, toys and home items. Retailers in the Atlanta district are meeting their targets, with greatest strength in apparel. Conditions are similar in Chicago, where apparel leads home improvement goods and appliances in gains over year-earlier levels. Chicago and Dallas characterize the retail sector as one of intense competition, but they are generally optimistic about the upcoming holiday season. Competition is also sharp in the Minneapolis district, but sales tax revenues indicate moderate strength in general merchandise sales. San Francisco indicates that demand for retail goods and services was solid overall. 
Reports on the auto sector are mixed. They are particularly strong in the Minneapolis district, where favorable crop incomes and overall economic strength bolstered September vehicle sales. For 
1/Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis based on information collected before October 22, 1996. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Cleveland, sales are up compared to a year ago, but somewhat below early 1996. Kansas City saw some slowing in September, but dealers expect sales to be ""fairly strong over the remainder of the year."" For Philadelphia, vehicle sales are reportedly steady, and for Dallas sales have slowed more than expected. 
Tourist spending is similarly mixed, with greatest strength along the East Coast. Tourism ""remains strong"" in New York. Richmond reports substantial strength in inland areas not affected by 
hurricanes. Atlanta lists brisk activity in Florida, the Mississippi Gulf Coast and New Orleans, and notes an upbeat outlook for tourism and convention activity. The Upper Midwest is less favored, with Minneapolis reporting a slow or somewhat disappointing summer season in its states. 
Manufacturing 
On balance, the manufacturing sector is largely stable to stronger, with considerable regional variation. Boston reports that a near majority of firms ""indicate solid sales gains from a year ago."" 
Cleveland describes the sector as strong with ""some pickup noted between August and September."" For Atlanta, ""contacts report increasing activity."" And for Chicago, activity increased in the district through early October. St. Louis notes reports of sales and employment increases and plant expansions far outnumbering reports of declines and closures. San Francisco's manufacturing sector expanded further, led by the aircraft sector. 
However, obvious strength in these districts contrasts with Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas, where manufacturing was steady to mixed; Philadelphia, where manufacturing gains in October were less widespread than in summer; and New York, where surveys of purchasing managers reported sharp improvement in local manufacturing in September. Several districts report localized effects from the auto workers strike in Canada, but none foresee significant or long-term effects. 
A number of districts report that manufacturing inventories are generally normal to somewhat below normal, and show little indication of either production bottlenecks or of weakening demand. 
Construction and real estate 
Construction is strong in several districts, but slackening in a few. New York notes that rising demand for apartments is spurring new construction, which had been dormant for some years. The 
Midwest is generally strong, with Minneapolis and St. Louis noting particular strength. Chicago reports increases in commercial and retail work are ""offsetting some slowing on the residential side."" Kansas City notes some slowing, but says that activity is still above a year ago. San Francisco characterizes the sector as generally robust, but with deceleration or weakness in some regions. 
However, slowing is apparent in the Southeast. Richmond describes some decrease in residential construction overall, but notes increases in materials prices and a shortage of skilled construction 
labor in North Carolina. In Atlanta, construction activity has fallen below year-earlier levels. Market conditions for residential and commercial real estate are mixed, with strength in the 
Northeast and West (New York, Boston, San Francisco) and some slackening in the Southeast (Richmond, Atlanta) and Midwest (Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City). 
Agriculture 
The 1996 crop is turning out better than many anticipated this spring, when drought scourged the Southwest and unseasonably cold, wet weather delayed planting on the Northern Plains and in the 
Midwest. Although crop development still lags usual levels in several districts, there is little damage from early frosts. Cleveland reports that the corn harvest was past the halfway mark in Kentucky and 
starting in Ohio. Chicago describes the harvest as ""well underway."" St. Louis says that corn and soybeans have generally ""reached full maturity,"" but notes that the harvest is slow in Illinois and Indiana. Minneapolis and Kansas City both tell of good to excellent yields, but with some harvest delays due to rain. The effects of drought continue to plague the Dallas district, especially corn and cotton. St. Louis also notes problems with cotton, in this case due to boll rot. Most winter wheat is grown in the Dallas and Kansas City districts; Dallas reports the new-crop condition as good, but Kansas City relates that fall planting is delayed by rain. 
Conditions are less favorable for livestock producers; a number of districts report continued losses for cattle ranchers. San Francisco notes a decline in beef exports to Japan. But there are some glimmers of improvement: Minneapolis reports that beef prices are not as bad as had been anticipated, while Kansas City says that profitability has returned to the feeding end of the sector and that ""feedlots are filling quickly."" Minneapolis and St. Louis report sharp increases in milk prices, in 
response to higher feed costs. The Chicago district has had more apparent cuts in hog and milk production than elsewhere but says that the rate of decline has slowed as feed costs have dropped. 
Energy, mining and forestry 
Natural resource sectors are generally robust. Dallas describes shortages of offshore rigs, drill pipe, and drilling crews and ""little capacity available anywhere"" in oil services. Kansas City activity improved somewhat from August to September, but the rig count was unchanged from a year ago. Minneapolis reports continued strong oil activity in North Dakota and very strong output in iron mines. Forest product output is reportedly steady. 
Financial institutions and credit 
Districts describe a financial sector that is stable to slightly stronger. New York lists increases in nonresidential mortgage loans and stability in other categories, along with some increase in delinquency rates. Philadelphia reports steady to slower loan activity. Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis and Dallas describe little significant change. Kansas City and San Francisco note strength in loan demand. St. Louis and San Francisco describe banking competition as ""fierce"" and ""sharp."" 
Labor markets Employment continues to grow in most districts. A majority, including Minneapolis, Chicago, Cleveland, Richmond, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco, describe labor markets as tight. For Minneapolis, labor markets ""constitute a constraint to increased output."" ""Labor shortages continue to be a problem in most areas,"" reports Chicago. Labor markets remained tight and wage increases more common, according to Kansas City, while Philadelphia reports that employers have had increasing difficulty finding qualified workers. The Northeast is an exception to this pattern. Labor availability is not a problem, according to Boston sources, and New York notes an acceleration in manufacturing job losses. 
Wages and prices 
Indications of upward pressure on wages continue to spread geographically and to grow in terms of affected occupations and ranges of skill levels. Wage pressures appear most quiescent in the East. Boston reports that a couple of manufacturers have frozen wages, but that most are granting increases 
of 2 percent to 4 percent. New York notes increases only in bonuses from Wall Street firms, and while Philadelphia lists labor shortage difficulties, it notes acute wage increases only for some entry- level clerical workers. Similarly, while Atlanta identifies increasing reports of labor shortages, wage pressures have apparently not systematically emerged. 
In the rest of the country, more pay increases are evident. Cleveland identifies ""steady pressure to increase wages"" for some specialties, while Richmond sees wage increases in low-unemployment areas and reports expectations of upward pressures in the next six months. Chicago says that ""wage pressures appear to have remained concentrated at the lower end of the pay scale, and ... this pressure may be intensifying."" For Kansas City, ""reports of rising wages increased,"" and in the Dallas district ""there were more reports of labor shortages leading to wage pressures."" San Francisco describes wage pressures as ""moderate overall,"" but points to ""upward pressure on the wages of entry-level workers ... has been added to existing upward pressure on wages for some categories of skilled workers."" The Minneapolis district apparently has the tightest labor markets, and notes ""increasing reports of compensation increases."" 
In contrast to some proliferation of wage increases, reports of price increases for raw materials, goods and services remain limited. Boston reports some increases in chemicals prices, but notes that half of manufacturers report no change in selling prices. New York reports that merchandise costs are generally flat. The cost of raw materials has not increased for most industrial firms surveyed by Philadelphia. Retailers contacted by Cleveland ""have not experienced any substantial price pressures"" and ""note price declines in consumer electronics."" Most of Atlanta's contacts expect no change in material or finished goods prices. St. Louis relates that some firms have experienced increases in raw materials prices but have been unable to pass them along, while other firms reported recent declines in raw material prices. From Minneapolis, price hikes generally remain scattered and small, while Dallas indicates ""more reports of lower prices than in the last beige book,"" although energy and some other materials were higher. Specific exceptions to this general pattern of low price pressures include Richmond, where manufacturers report increasing prices for finished goods and raw materials in September, and Kansas City, where retail prices held steady but those for some manufacturing and construction materials rose.",0,1
1996-10-31,"Inflation indicators from the District reports were varied and generally inconclusive, although there appears to be greater upward pressure on wages than on prices. Business activity in most Districts is reported to be generally good and expanding moderately. Wages and Prices 
Reports of substantial price increases were notably absent from many District summaries. Several Districts indicated that consumer prices are either stable or rising only slightly (Boston, New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City). Price increases were cited for a wide variety of industrial commodities, but these appear to be confined to a small set of markets, such as lumber (Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas), steel (Cleveland and Chicago), and various agricultural commodities including grains and dairy products. Several Districts also noted price declines in a few areas, especially memory chips (Boston and Dallas). 
Wage gains have tended to outstrip price increases, however. The Richmond District sees ""widespread"" upward pressure on wages, and rising labor costs were also 
noted in the San Francisco District. The Boston District's wage and salary increases are in the 2% to 4% range. In Cleveland, wage growth is reportedly 2% to 3%, although ""the cost of new hires is accelerating."" This is consistent with the Minneapolis report, in which 
Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected prior to September 4, 1996. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii several sources observed ""upward pressure on entry-level wages."" The Chicago District 
notes that small retailers in Michigan were ""raising their starting wages to attract qualified workers,"" but most contacts reported no discernible acceleration in wages. In the 
remaining regions, upward wage pressures were characterized as either ""subdued"" (as in the New York and Chicago Districts), or ""scattered"" (Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas). 
None of the Districts indicated inflationary pressures are subsiding and at least one report noted that price increases are expected to intensify. According to the San Francisco District, although about 55% of respondents see inflation remaining constant over the next 12 months, ""nearly 40% expect [inflation] to accelerate."" 
Labor Markets 
Many District reports indicated pockets of labor market tightness, and in a few regions, this tightness appears to be broadly based. In the Richmond District, tight labor markets are ""widespread,"" labor markets ""remained tight in much of the [Kansas City] District,"" the Chicago District's labor markets are ""tighter than the nation as a whole,"" and tight labor markets ""continue to be a concern for most contacts"" in the St. Louis District. Elsewhere, ""some reports of labor shortages"" were noted in the San Francisco District, and a number of District summaries contained scattered indications of labor shortages in entry-level positions, retailing, and some skilled occupations. Low unemployment rates were noted in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts. 
Business Activity Overall, the District reports reveal a moderately expanding economy, with only a 
few exceptions: Growth in the San Francisco District is characterized as ""strong,"" and the St. Louis region has ""continued to moderate slightly."" 
Manufacturing 
In most Districts, industrial activity is either expanding or holding steady at a high level. Richmond reports ""substantially faster"" manufacturing growth. Although a moderation in industrial production growth is seen in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts, both report continued high levels of production. Orders growth is indicated by many Districts (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas). Notable exceptions include continued cutbacks or closings in apparel and textiles (Atlanta and St. Louis) and drop-offs in heavy truck production (Cleveland and San Francisco). Only a few constraints on industrial capacity are reported, and capacity increases are occurring in the Boston and Atlanta Districts. 
Retailing 
The back-to-school shopping season got off to a good start, and several Districts indicated that sales are meeting--or exceeding--expectations. A good number of Districts reported strong apparel sales (Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City), although these vary by type and outlet. Household appliances and other ""big-ticket"" items are a noted weakness in two reports (Cleveland and Chicago). 
iv 
Overall, inventories are considered ""in line with sales,"" and the Boston District reported that some retailers are ""cautiously building inventories."" While auto sales are generally described as flat or declining slightly, thin car stocks are seen as a contributing factor (Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas). 
Real Estate and Construction 
Building activity remains strong in most parts of the country. The Chicago District reports ""robust"" construction, Minneapolis sees all types of construction as ""brisk,"" and 
Kansas City indicates ""solid"" home building activity. The San Francisco District reports ""tight"" residential and commercial real estate markets in most areas, and office vacancy rates are low in parts of the New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. Construction and sales vary more for residential properties than for commercial ones. Boston reports the residential real estate market to be in good shape across much of New England. Residential real estate has improved in the New York District, and inventory problems are noted in downstate New York and Massachusetts. However, softer residential markets are reported in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas regions. 
Banking and FinancialMarkets 
Loan demand appears to be holding steady at a generally high level. Exceptions to this trend include the Richmond District, where overall lending has slowed slightly, the Atlanta District, where demand is ""moderate,"" and the St. Louis District, which saw slight declines in total loans between mid-June and mid-August Borrowing activity is mixed by category. Several Districts indicate a moderation in commercial lending (New York, 
v 
Richmond, and St. Louis), but some also see relatively strong commercial lending growth (Chicago and San Francisco). Consumer borrowing reports are equally varied. While 
some deterioration in credit quality and increases in delinquency rates were noted, no concerns about overall debt quality were expressed. 
SeasonalIndustries 
Agricultural conditions vary widely by District, but most regions report better crop conditions today than earlier in the summer. Still, a delayed planting season has resulted in underdeveloped crops in many areas, and there is concern that crops could be threatened in the event of an early frost (Chicago and Minneapolis). The Richmond and Kansas City Districts report very good corn and soybean crops. High feed costs are contributing to livestock liquidations, and milk production is down substantially from last year (Chicago and Minneapolis). 
Districts with a significant tourist trade reported mixed results for the summer season. ""Ticket revenues for the Olympics, overall, exceeded projections,"" according to Atlanta. That District also notes that while tourism in central Florida remains strong, its other, non-Olympic venues have been disappointing. In New York, hotel occupancy rates are near record highs, and the San Francisco District indicates strong hotel occupancy and other tourism trade in several states. The Richmond region had ""below average"" tourism revenues in the Atlantic coastal areas, and a ""weak, but not disastrous year"" for tourism was reported in the Minneapolis District.",0,1
1996-08-31,"The economy continued to expand in June and July, though in some areas the pace of growth has moderated since the last report. A number of districts report tight labor markets, especially for entry-level workers; however, wage pressures remained subdued. Retail sales slowed in most districts, particularly for non-auto durables. Many districts report continued expansion in the manufacturing sector, and a number have seen a pickup in hiring. Most manufacturers and retailers report that inventories were roughly on target. Housing markets remained fairly strong in most districts, though a few areas report a slowdown; a number of districts note particular strength in the multi-family segment. Commercial and industrial real estate markets continued to firm in almost all districts. A number of districts note brisk tourism activity-especially on the east and west coasts. 
Crop conditions have generally improved since the last report, although late plantings across the Midwest raise the potential for damage in the event of an early frost. While there are scattered reports of rising commodity prices, most districts report that input prices, as well as prices for finished goods, were essentially flat. Most districts report increased demand for commercial and industrial loans, but softer demand for consumer and mortgage loans. CONSUMER SPENDING 
Retail sales softened in most districts, though sales were generally up from a year-ago. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas note some

ii weakening since the last report. However, contacts in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San 
Francisco say that sales remained strong. Retail inventories were generally on target. Demand for non-auto big ticket durables-such as home furnishings, appliances and 
electronics-was particularly soft in several districts (New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City). Auto sales were mixed; most districts report steady sales , but Kansas City reports a pickup, while Dallas notes some softening. New York and Chicago report that unusually cool weather may have contributed to weakness in seasonal items, such as fans and air conditioners. Apparel sales were fairly good in the New York, Atlanta, Kansas City and San Francisco districts, but were weak in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas areas. 
MANUFACTURING 
Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most districts. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco report that conditions firmed. However, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas note some softening. Cleveland and Chicago also report some recent moderation in growth, but add that the sector is still strong. Most districts report that inventory levels were in line, although they were a bit high in Richmond. However, auto-industry suppliers in the St. Louis and Chicago districts report lean inventories, and this has hindered light truck assemblies. 
Conditions in high-tech industries are very strong in Minneapolis but weak in Dallas; San Francisco notes increased activity in research and development, but some moderation in growth 
of computer manufacturing. Dallas reports increased demand for energy-related products. 
REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Residential real estate markets remain fairly strong in most districts. Some slowing was observed in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Louis districts. However, Boston, New York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco report continued improvement. Boston, New York and Atlanta noted particular strength in the multi-family housing market. 
Commercial real estate continued to firm in almost all areas. Tight markets and declining vacancy rates are cited in Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. St. Louis and Atlanta report mixed conditions, with the latter mentioning strong demand for office and industrial space, but softening demand for retail space. NONFINANCIAL SERVICES AND TOURISM 
Service activity continued to expand in districts that report on this sector. A monthly survey of service sector firms in the Richmond district shows increased activity in July. 
Temporary employment firms and contractors in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts report brisk business. San Francisco reports a pickup in software development activity. 
Tourism has been notably brisk in the seaboard regions-Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Minneapolis reports that tourism is below expectations, but roughly on par with last year. The Olympics have clearly attracted large numbers of tourists to the Atlanta area, and other parts of the district have benefitted as well-large numbers of Atlanta residents reportedly visited Florida during the games. However, some of the district's other traditional destinations report disappointing traffic. 
FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Banks in virtually all districts report that demand has softened for consumer and mortgage loans but strengthened for commercial and industrial loans. The New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts report increased demand for business loans, while Philadelphia and Kansas City report steady demand. However, consumer and mortgage loan activity weakened in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Banks in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago indicate some increase in loan delinquencies, while Cleveland reports that delinquency rates have leveled off. Insurance companies in the Boston district report mixed sales of insurance products but increased mutual funds sales. AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE-RELATED INDUSTRIES 
Crop conditions were mixed but generally improved since the last report. Contacts in St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City report that crops were generally in good condition; conditions were below normal but improving in Cleveland and Chicago. Late crop plantings in the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts raise the potential for crop damage in the event of an early frost. A severe drought in the Dallas district-and parts of the St. Louis district-has caused extensive damage to corn and other crops, although recent rainfalls have helped somewhat. Hurricane Bertha caused some moderate crop damage in the Richmond district. 
The energy industry has picked up in the Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas districts, with contacts reporting increased drilling activity. The strength is largely attributed to high crude oil and natural gas prices, while Minneapolis also cites new seismic and drilling technologies as a 
factor. 
EMPLOYMENT & WAGES 
Labor markets remain tight, but there has been no widespread increase in wage pressures. Contacts in virtually all districts outside the Northeast cite tight labor markets and scattered shortages of both skilled and entry-level workers; most report that wage pressures remain subdued, though San Francisco reports that ""wage inflation pressures are evident in some areas"". Businesses in Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas mention limited availability of entry-level workers; contacts in Philadelphia and Richmond report increased demand for temporary workers; Chicago reports shortages of construction workers and professionals. PRICES 
Despite scattered reports of rising commodity prices, most districts report that both input prices and costs of finished goods were, on balance, flat. Manufacturers in Boston and Richmond report stable to declining input prices; those in New York, Chicago and Kansas City report some rise in materials costs. Other districts report mixed trends in raw materials costs; steel prices reportedly increased in Chicago and Kansas City but declined in Cleveland and Dallas. Prices for finished goods were generally flat in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts, and up slightly in Boston and Richmond. Contacts in Philadelphia and Atlanta attribute the difficulty of raising prices to intense competition. Cattle farmers have been pinched by weak cattle prices and rising feed prices. Corn and soybean prices fell sharply in late July, after surging in preceding weeks. 
Some areas report an escalation in real estate costs. Contacts in Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas note upward pressure on commercial rents. Boston and New 
vi York also report some firming of residential rents. St. Louis mentions a pickup in new home 
prices, driven by rising costs of both land and construction materials.",1,1
1996-07-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic activity continued to advance at a moderate pace in May and early June. Nearly all districts report expanding activity, and several indicate the pace of growth accelerated recently. The retail and service industries generally strengthened, and manufacturing activity improved in several districts. Residential and commercial construction activity also picked up in most districts, although wet weather hampered homebuilding in some areas. Loan demand increased in most districts, despite a decline in mortgage lending. In the natural resource industries, agriculture was hurt in several districts by unfavorable weather and low cattle prices, while energy activity increased in regions producing oil and natural gas. 
Several districts note rising prices for some raw and intermediate products, especially building materials, petroleum products, and grain. Evidence of rising prices for retail products, however, was much less widespread. Most districts continued to report tight labor markets for both entry-level and skilled workers, although indications of rising wages remained scattered. RETAIL 
Retail sales strengthened in nearly all districts, with sales generally exceeding year-ago levels. The only exceptions were the Boston and New York districts. In the Boston district, retailers indicated that recent sales were disappointing, especially in off-price discount stores, 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and based on information collected before June 11, 1996. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii but they were generally optimistic about sales prospects during the remainder of the year. In the 
New York district, sales slowed slightly in early June after exceeding expectations in May. Recent sales gains followed normal seasonal patterns in most districts. Retailers in the 
New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas districts report strong sales of seasonal items such as air conditioners, men's and women's apparel, and lawn and garden products. In the Cleveland and Chicago districts, however, unusually wet weather slowed sales of home improvement products and other seasonal items. 
Automobile sales remained strong in most districts. Dealers in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis districts attribute part of the recent sales strength to various sales incentive programs. Some popular models were in short supply in the Cleveland and Kansas City districts. The Philadelphia district, however, reports weak sales of heavy trucks. MANUFACTURING 
Manufacturing activity improved in several regions, while pockets of weakness remained in some districts. Districts reporting generally improved manufacturing activity include Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Reports from the Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis districts indicate manufacturing activity was uneven or flat. 
Activity improved in a wide range of industries. Both consumer and capital-goods industries improved in the Boston district. In the Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco 
districts, industrial machine and tool manufacturing strengthened. Construction-related industries were strong in the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Conditions in the oil field equipment industry improved in the Dallas district. 
iii 
Some districts report weak spots in manufacturing activity, however. In the Boston district, demand for hospital equipment was weak, reportedly due to lower cost health care plans. The heavy truck and construction equipment industries remained soft in the Cleveland and Chicago districts. In the Dallas district, the semiconductor industry remained weak, due to a slump in demand for computers and related products. SERVICES 
Service activity continued to expand in districts reporting on this sector. In the Boston district, demand for temporary workers continued to strengthen. Service producers in the Richmond district indicate that employment rose in May, although revenues declined slightly. The San Francisco district reports strong demand for computer-related services, telecommunications, and long-distance trucking. 
The tourism industry remained robust. The New York district reports hotel occupancy in New York City remained at a 16-year high. In the Richmond district, tourism activity picked up in May despite wet weather. The Atlanta district reports strong gains in attendance at Florida hotels and theme parks and rising gambling revenues in Mississippi. Also, the approaching Olympic Games have apparently boosted passenger traffic at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport. In the Minneapolis district, the tourism industry holds optimistic expectations for the summer, even though the season's start was delayed by cold, wet weather. CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE 
Residential real estate activity generally strengthened in most districts, including New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Signs of sluggishness emerged in some districts, however. Housing sales slowed in some parts 
iv 
ofthe Boston and New York districts. Builders in the Richmond district report declining buyer interest in new homes, although housing sales rose. In the Chicago district, wet weather slowed homebuilding and sales, but builders expected a stronger third quarter. 
Commercial real estate activity continued to improve in most districts. The Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta districts report declining office vacancy rates, higher rents, and gains in commercial construction activity. The Minneapolis district reports solid gains in contracts for large projects. In the Dallas district, the tightest supply of suburban office space in a decade was pushing up rents. A few districts report a weakening in commercial activity. The New York district reports office vacancy rates edged up in New York City in May. In the St. Louis district, commercial construction slowed in some areas of Tennessee and Arkansas. BANKING AND FINANCE 
Overall loan demand rose in most districts, although demand for commercial loans and consumer loans varied among the districts. Demand for commercial and industrial loans was 
strong in the New York, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts, and was flat to down slightly in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis districts. Demand for consumer loans was strong in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas districts, and flat to down slightly in the New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts. The Cleveland and Chicago districts report intense competition among lenders. Mortgage lending and refinancing declined in most districts. In the Boston district, assets managed and employment at investment management firms strengthened. 
V 
AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE-RELATED INDUSTRIES Agriculture was hurt in several districts by unfavorable weather and low cattle prices. 
Wet weather delayed the planting of spring crops and slowed crop development in the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts. The Cleveland and Chicago districts report that more favorable weather recently enabled corn and soybean planting to progress. Recent rains improved crop conditions in some parts of the Richmond district. The wet weather arrived too late in the Kansas City district, however, to avert an expected sharp decline in winter wheat production caused by drought earlier in the year. In the Dallas district, drought sharply reduced the expected size of the winter wheat crop and trimmed pasture and forage supplies. 
The St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts report unfavorable conditions in the livestock industry, due to low cattle prices and high feed costs. 
Energy activity improved somewhat in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts, despite declining energy prices. The Minneapolis district reports stronger iron mining activity and mixed conditions in the forest products industry. PRICES AND WAGES 
Prices advanced for some raw and intermediate materials in several districts, especially for building materials, petroleum-based products, and agricultural commodities. Evidence of rising prices for finished products and at the retail level was less widespread. The Boston, Kansas City, and Dallas districts report higher prices for building materials, including lumber. Prices for packaging materials, some plastics, machinery, and steel were up in the Atlanta district. Higher wheat prices pushed up flour prices in the Minneapolis district, but otherwise had little effect on retail food prices Manufacturers in the Boston and Richmond districts report 
vi rising product prices, but flat to slightly lower materials prices. In the St. Louis district, some 
manufacturers report difficulty in raising product prices due to highly competitive markets. Retail prices held steady in the Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts and rose more slowly in May than in April in the Richmond district. Retailers in the New York district, however, indicated that a decline in price discounting was boosting effective retail prices. 
Most districts continued to report tight labor markets for both entry-level and skilled workers. The Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts report a tight market for retail workers. In the Boston and Chicago districts, the number of temporary workers shifting to permanent assignments was increasing. Markets for skilled laborers remained tight in the Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City districts. The Boston district reports that a tight local labor market has prompted area businesses to recruit professional workers from other parts of the country. 
Reports of rising wages are scattered, despite widespread tightness in labor markets. The Boston district reports rising wages in manufacturing. In the St. Louis district, some fast-food establishments offer wages above the minimum wage and include a signing bonus. The approaching Olympic Games were pushing up entry-level wages in the Atlanta district.",1,0
1996-05-31,"Economic activity advanced at a moderate pace in March and April, according to reports from the Federal Reserve Banks. All the districts with the exception of New York indicated that economic activity expanded, and several noted that the pace of expansion had quickened recently. Both retail sales and manufacturing activity picked up somewhat. In addition, manufacturers' inventories appeared to be at or near expected levels in several districts. Activity also picked up in nonfinancial services, commercial and consumer lending, and real estate. Mortgage loan activity slowed, as did tourism in several districts, and agriculture suffered from adverse weather. 
Price increases remained generally subdued and there were only scattered reports of wage pressures despite continued tight labor markets and somewhat stronger economic growth. Several District banks noted the sharp increases that had occurred in oil and grain prices, but Dallas observed that oil price futures pointed to a near-term decline. CONSUMER SPENDING 
Most districts reported gains in retail sales, but the Boston and New York districts indicated that retail sales were mixed and San Francisco said that sales were stable. Six districts noted that apparel sales were up from the previous year and several attributed the uptick to warmer weather. Retailers in several districts expected a moderate increase in sales over the next few months. The Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas

businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii districts reported strong auto sales, while the Philadelphia and Chicago districts reported 
that auto sales were sluggish. Most districts said that retail inventories were near desired levels and were consistent with their contacts' expectations of increased sales. 
MANUFACTURING 
Manufacturing output strengthened by varying degrees in nine of the twelve districts. The growth rate picked up in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. 
Louis, and Minneapolis; Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported that plants in their districts were operating at moderate to high levels of capacity. However, 
manufacturing conditions were mixed in New York and weakened somewhat in Atlanta. Dallas said activity was below the level of a year ago but that April manufacturing orders rebounded from March. The Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Minneapolis districts indicated that manufacturers' inventories were at or near desired levels; Kansas City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco reported that inventories were edging down; and Atlanta said that inventories were increasing moderately. 
District banks reported varying pockets of strength and weakness in manufacturing. Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis noted increased demand for auto and auto-related products. Boston, Atlanta, and Minneapolis all reported stronger demand for electronic and computer-related equipment. Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas indicated that the market for building materials showed gains. 
In contrast, Philadelphia noted that some of their firms which produce homebuilding products and materials saw declining demand. Dallas indicated that the 
growth in demand for semiconductors and telecommunications equipment had weakened 
iii in recent months. Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis reported excess capacity 
and rising inventories of paper products. 
NONFINANCIAL SERVICES 
Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that the service sector was generally healthy in their districts. Philadelphia reported strong demand for 
computer-oriented businesses, while San Francisco noted an increase in demand for both computer and telephone communication services. 
An earlier Easter and colder-than-normal temperatures hampered beach tourism activity in the Richmond and Atlanta districts. Minneapolis indicated that the long 
winter was damping tourism activity in February and March. In contrast, Philadelphia reported that tourism was healthy in their district, with increased bookings for conferences and business meetings in the Pocono Mountain region of Pennsylvania. Spring bookings were also higher in the Richmond and Atlanta districts, and Minneapolis said that business owners were optimistic about bookings for the spring and summer. REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Most Districts reported that residential real estate activity increased; some contacts characterized the activity as ""brisk."" Housing sales strengthened in the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. The Richmond and Kansas City districts indicated that housing starts were steady. Kansas City reported that the stock of unsold homes was lean, while Atlanta said that home inventories were ""in good shape."" Pockets of strength in western and southern New York were overshadowed by sluggish markets in northern New Jersey and upstate New York; one New Jersey contact described the market there as ""listless."" 
iv Commercial real estate activity also increased in most districts. Dallas, 
Richmond, and Atlanta reported strong leasing activity with low vacancy rates and high rental rates. The Dallas, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts noted strong growth in construction activity; Atlanta reported that several speculative projects were under way and more were anticipated. Boston indicated that its commercial real estate market improved somewhat, and New York reported a stable commercial real estate market. San Francisco, however, indicated that the market was soft in the Los Angeles area, and Chicago noted that commercial development remained slow, despite positive absorption rates and firming rents in office and retail space. 
The recent uptick in mortgage rates had mixed effects on real estate and construction activity. Chicago and Richmond reported that the rise may have spurred 
potential homebuyers to take action. The New York district reported that the increased rates had no apparent effects. FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Overall lending activity increased slightly in most districts with moderate gains in commercial and consumer lending activity offsetting weaker residential mortgage and home refinancing activity. The demand for consumer loans was mixed across districts- increasing in Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Dallas but decreasing in Chicago and St. Louis. In the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts, the demand for consumer loans remained steady. New York and Cleveland reported that loan delinquency rates were unchanged. However, Chicago reported that loan delinquency rates rose, although overall credit quality was unchanged. St. Louis reported a slight increase in nonperforming consumer loans. 
AGRICULTURE 
Agriculture was adversely affected by the weather and high feed costs in March and April, according to district bank reports. Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that severe drought conditions had damaged the winter wheat crop; Richmond and St. Louis said that crops there suffered from the lingering effects of winter's severe temperatures. In contrast, Minneapolis indicated that the wheat crop held up well. Several banks cited the small wheat crop and tight carryover stocks as reasons for soaring grain prices. Dallas, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco noted that high livestock feed costs combined with low livestock prices were leading to financial stress among ranchers and some feedlot operators. San Francisco and Richmond reported that fruit trees were in worse than normal condition, and St. Louis indicated that an early spring freeze resulted in the loss of 75 percent of the Arkansas peach crop. Kansas City noted that spring planting activity may be delayed by the drought; Minneapolis reported that planting delays have resulted from unseasonably wet weather. 
EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES 
Most Districts reported tight labor markets but only scattered upward pressure on wages. Tighter markets for manufacturing workers were noted by St. Louis and Kansas City. Chicago said that labor shortages were the main concern of businesses there, although demand for manufacturing workers had softened. Boston indicated that some manufacturers experienced difficulty in filling software and telecommunication positions. The Atlanta and Kansas City districts reported shortages of retail workers. While Dallas reported fewer labor shortages overall, a short supply of skilled workers had caused 
vi delays in the construction of warehouses and office buildings. Cleveland indicated that 
labor shortages were occurring less frequently than a year ago. Districts generally reported only modest wage pressures, although St. Louis said 
several industries experienced increased labor costs and Minneapolis reported wage increases of 4 to 5 percent. Kansas City said that wages rose for skilled workers such as welders and machinists. PRICES 
Most districts reported little upward pressure on prices other than sharply higher prices for grains and energy-related items. Boston, New York, and Atlanta reported that prices in their districts changed little. Price increases in the San Francisco district continued to be moderate overall. Retail prices were steady in Kansas City and increased slightly in Richmond. Materials prices rose in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts but declined slightly in Richmond. Richmond indicated that service-sector and finished goods prices increased slightly. Atlanta reported some pockets of price deflation in lumber and paper, and Dallas reported that oil prices were likely to decline soon. Contacts in the Philadelphia district expected increases in the prices of purchased supplies and materials over the summer. 
Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported sharp increases in grain prices; however, the Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts noted lower livestock prices. St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated prices for fuels rose, and Dallas and Minneapolis reported price hikes in plastics.",1,1
1996-04-30,"Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts suggest the national economy grew modestly in January and February. Over half the districts cite moderate economic growth or continuing solid levels of economic activity. Most of the others mention recent improvements, largely reflecting rebounds from weather-related slowdowns earlier in the year. 
Accounts of manufacturing activity are mixed. More than half the districts report gains in at least some industries or sub-regions, but Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas suggest production is either level or growing more slowly than in the last report. Retail results generally improved in February, but in several districts these improvements represent only a partial recovery from weak sales during the holidays and January. 
Wage and price pressures are generally described as subdued, notwithstanding observations of tight labor markets in several districts. Wages are reported to be increasing at a modest pace. Retail prices are rising only slightly if at all. Most commodity prices are said to be steady, stabilizing, or increasing very little; a few are falling. 
RETAIL Districts across the country report weak retail sales in January; most, 
but not all, note an encouraging pick-up in February. Severe winter weather contributed to January's slow pace, particularly on the East Coast. February's uptick in sales was not seen in parts of the west and mid-west, where the San Francisco, St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts note continued

sluggishness. Durable goods and electronics are typically selling better than apparel, although some respondents observe a rise in demand for selected clothing items. Contacts in New York and Chicago report the largest sales gains in stores at the high end of the market. 
Retailers in a majority of districts are optimistic that sales will pick up in the next few months. The outlook for those in the Cleveland, San Francisco, Dallas, and Minneapolis districts is more guarded. Upward movements in retail prices continue to be limited. Reports from Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis indicate vendor prices generally remain stable. 
Auto dealers in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City districts report improved sales in February, following a disappointing January. Dallas notes sluggish sales in both months, leaving inventories larger than desired. Contacts in the Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City districts express more optimism about this spring's auto sales than those in Dallas, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. 
TOURISM 
Excellent skiing conditions on the East Coast boosted tourism in the Boston and Richmond districts. Atlanta reports strong tourism and convention business, particularly in Florida, where northerners are fleeing to escape harsher than usual winter weather. Minneapolis notes a drop in tourism because of poor skiing conditions in Montana, an unfavorable Canadian exchange rate, and the temporary federal shutdown of South Dakota's national parks and monuments. 
OTHER NON-FINANCIAL SERVICES 
In most districts surveying business services, demand accelerated in February from a seasonal or weather-related lull in January; elsewhere, services continued to expand at a good pace over both months. Dallas notes gains in accounting and transportation while San Francisco reports growing exports of high-tech services like telecommunications, software, and financial 
iii 
consulting. The demand for temporary workers picked up in Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas, with Chicago noting ongoing labor shortages and Richmond reporting that temporary workers' wages rose faster than the general price level over the last year. 
MANUFACTURING 
Manufacturing activity has been mixed but fairly flat on average. Several Federal Reserve Banks in the middle of the country (Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas) report slightly slower sales and orders, while the majority of districts to the east (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta) indicate a slight strengthening since the latter part of 1995 or the beginning of 1996. Only the San Francisco report has a generally positive tone for recent months, based largely on trends for machinery and equipment. 
A number of districts report growing demand for capital goods, notably industrial machinery, with Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago citing a boost from exports. Sales of electronic and computer-related equipment appear to be rising, although Minneapolis reports a slowing rate of growth for computer components, and Dallas notes a drop-off in demand for memory chips and microprocessors. St. Louis and Dallas indicate robust markets for cement. Auto-related and apparel demand are widely reported to be sluggish, and paper mills are experiencing declining sales according to contacts in several districts. 
Manufacturers throughout the country report little or diminished materials cost pressures. Paper prices in particular are falling, and lumber prices are either falling or have ceased to rise. Several districts note growing wage pressures or tight markets for some categories of manufacturing workers. Overall wage inflation reportedly remains moderate, however. Philadelphia and Richmond report recent declines in finished goods prices, while most other districts indicate little or no increase. Several districts attribute the modest size of upward price movements to competitive conditions in addition to the lack of cost pressures. 
REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION All districts report increased interest and activity in residential real 
estate; most also report increased residential sales. Among those with higher sales, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas indicate low-priced and subsidized houses have done better than higher-priced homes. Upstate New York and Philadelphia continue having excess inventories of housing stock. Prices are said to be stable in most districts, but appear to be showing some increase in the Kansas City (especially for low-priced homes) and Richmond districts and in the San Francisco Bay area. Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City are seeing an increase in new residential construction, and San Francisco notes increased construction of apartment 
buildings in Arizona. Commercial real estate markets have also experienced increased activity. 
New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas report rising demand for commercial space. Vacancy rates are said to have dropped in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco districts. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco report increased commercial construction in their districts. 
Contacts in all districts anticipate a strong and active spring season. Despite some concern about interest rates and about overbuilding in selected areas, respondents are optimistic about both residential and commercial real estate activity during the upcoming months. 
FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Loan demand appears to be increasing in the majority of districts, although it has eased in Cleveland and California. Most districts indicate that demand for commercial loans has risen more than the demand for consumer credit. Contacts in New York, Atlanta, and Cleveland report slightly higher loan delinquencies. Respondents in all districts reporting on bank activity mention a surge in refinancing activity. 
AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
Arctic cold, drought, and fire have damaged the winter wheat crop and pasturage in much of the St. Louis, Kansas City and Dallas districts. In addition, in the Richmond district, parts of the Pacific Northwest, and the eastern Dakotas, floods or heavy snows have also hurt crops. With uncertain prospects for the 1996 harvest and tight global inventories, grain prices are at their highest levels in many years. While these conditions are benefiting grain farmers in the parts of the Minneapolis and San Francisco districts that have adequate moisture, ranchers are caught in a squeeze. With the ratio of livestock prices to grain prices unusually low, the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts report declines in ranch profits. In Minneapolis, bankers reportedly expect a rise in ranch liquidations. Beef exports to Canada and Asia are helping to support producers in the San Francisco district. 
In other natural resource industries, conditions are mixed. Iron mines in the Minneapolis district shipped at the highest level in over a decade, while output from nonferrous mines stayed stable. Energy prices are reportedly volatile, with natural gas and fuel oil prices fluctuating at high levels, while crude oil prices are relatively weak. Dallas and Minneapolis report strong gas and oil exploration activity, but in Kansas City and Dallas, the operating rig count remains low.",1,1
1996-02-29,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the national economy was growing at a generally modest pace at the end of 1995. Holiday retail sales were generally reported to be below expectations, with extensive discounting. Manufacturers saw uneven growth, with weakness noted in auto-related production. The federal government shutdown hurt winter tourism at national parks, but other areas reported increased activity. Single-family home sales are experiencing some seasonal slowing in most of the country. However, commercial real estate contacts in many areas report strengthened markets. Loan demand is steady in most areas. Firms say that prices are generally remaining stable, but some areas still report shortages of skilled workers. CONSUMER SPENDING 
Retail sales during December generally fell below retailers' expectations, with heavy discounting the rule. However, the majority of retailers in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts experienced moderate growth over last year's levels. Reports from Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco retail contacts indicated that year-over- year growth was mixed within each of these regions. According to District contacts, electronics, computers, fine jewelry, and cosmetics were the best-selling items, while apparel sales were generally disappointing. According to retailers in the New York and Cleveland Districts, overall retail sales suffered because of harsh weather; however, hardware stores got a boost from high

ii demand for snow-related equipment. Merchants in the Atlanta, Kansas City, New York, and 
St. Louis Districts report that inventories are in line with plans. Overall, retailers' outlook for the first quarter is guarded, with retailers in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts anticipating little growth year-over-year, while the St. Louis District's outlook is mixed. Several retailers in the Dallas District are contemplating scaling back new store openings, and contacts in the Boston and Cleveland Districts anticipate rising retail vacancy rates this year. 
Sluggish auto sales were reported in the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. Dallas was the only District that noted auto sales increases. 
MANUFACTURING 
Overall factory activity was mixed, according to District reports. Manufacturing output growth has slowed in Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond since the last Beigebook. Atlanta, Chicago, and Cleveland report recent orders weakness for auto suppliers. New orders have fallen for heavy equipment producers in Minneapolis. Dallas reports weaker orders for manufacturers over the past six weeks and points to a slight deceleration in the rapid growth of semiconductor production. San Francisco also reports excess capacity and rising inventories among some California semiconductor firms, but notes that, in general, demand for electronic goods continues strong. 
Manufacturers continue to operate at high levels in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City. Machine tool orders in Boston are above year-ago levels, and computer products continue to grow robustly. Steel orders have improved for producers in the Chicago and Cleveland Districts. St. Louis reports that although the pace of industrial activity remains relatively unchanged, new announcements of large plant openings will add to the District's factory 
iii payrolls. Atlanta contacts anticipate that rebounding home sales and construction will boost 
building material and carpet production. TOURISM AND CONVENTION BUSINESS 
The Federal Government shutdown is hurting winter business in national parks, according to District reports. However, an early and above-normal snowfall has boosted tourism in the Minneapolis and Richmond Districts. Visits by Europeans are up, and advance bookings are strong in southern and central Florida. REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Contacts in most Districts report a slowdown in single-family home sales during December mainly because of seasonal factors. However, home sales improved over last year in Cleveland, 
while sales equaled last year's levels in the Kansas City District and fell slightly in the Atlanta District. Single-family home construction in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts fell slightly behind last year's levels and equaled last year in Cleveland. Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City District Realtors report tight home inventories in several markets. Both Atlanta and Kansas City District contacts report rising home prices, while Richmond contacts reported declines. Real estate contacts in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts are optimistic going into 1996, while contacts in the Minnesota District anticipate building will be somewhat less. 
Nationally, commercial real estate contacts report improving markets. Real estate agents in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and New York Districts report that new multifamily construction and conversion is strong. However, reports from the Dallas District indicate that worries about overbuilding are causing developers to curtail plans for new projects. Contacts in the Atlanta and 
Dallas Districts report that build-to-suit projects dominate nonresidential construction activity. 
iv Office vacancy rates continue to decline in the Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, and Dallas Districts; 
however, downtown Boston and midtown Manhattan have shown little improvement recently. Overall, commercial real estate contacts report a positive outlook. FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Loan demand appears to be steady, according to reports from most Districts. In general, loan demand is stronger from businesses than from consumers. Refinancing activity has increased for all loan types. Banks say that, although credit quality remains very good, delinquencies have increased modestly in the majority of Districts. Contacts in the Atlanta and New York Districts report weaker consumer loan demand since the last Beigebook; but in southern California, as well as in the Cleveland, Dallas, and St. Louis Districts, stronger demand was noted. On the commercial side, loan demand was reported as strong in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and St. Louis Districts. Only the Richmond District noted weaker commercial loan demand. AGRICULTURE AND FOREST PRODUCTS 
Agricultural conditions across the U.S. were, for the most part, reported to be normal for the season. Notable exceptions include the Dallas and Kansas City Districts where dry weather and insect damage have hurt the winter wheat crops. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, and 
San Francisco Districts reported slower lumber and forest product production. 
WAGES AND PRICES 
Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, Chicago, Richmond, and San Francisco report some shortages of skilled labor. Manufacturers in Dallas say that lack of skilled workers is a major concern, and wage pressures remain prevalent. In Chicago, placement specialists note a high number of unfilled orders for permanent and temporary employees. Most manufacturers report modest wage and salary 
v 
increases. Some Districts, such as Boston, report few or reduced cost pressures. There are scattered reports ofincreasing materials prices in some Districts, but prices remain generally stable, according to their contacts.",1,1
1995-11-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts suggest that moderate growth in economic activity continued in early fall, although perhaps at a slower pace than at the time of the previous set of reports. The evidence of a possible slowing in demand mainly was from the reports on consumer spending, which suggested a pause in retail sales in some districts. However, a pickup in exports and strong domestic demand for certain types of business equipment led to stable or increased manufacturing activity in most districts, after the dropback earlier in the year. Although the summer rebound in residential construction 
was not generally augmented by additional gains, the slightly improved level of building activity appeared to be maintained in recent months. Some districts reported that nonresidential construction strengthened, and several districts noted a firming in commercial and industrial leasing activity. A few districts reported new manifestations of labor market tightness, but overall wage gains remained moderate, and reports of rapidly rising materials costs have lessened substantially. 
Retail Trade Retail sales, on the whole, appeared to be soft in early 
fall. Several of the districts with preliminary reports on

ii October sales--Boston, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia--noted 
some signs of weakened spending, although this partly was attributed to weather-related sales volatility. Elsewhere, retail sales results generally were described as disappointing and below expectations. Retail inventories are somewhat heavy with fall merchandise in several districts, and some retailers have scaled back stocking plans to prevent a further runup. 
Apparel and other soft goods appear to have been the weakest sales areas. Reports on sales of autos and other big ticket 
items were mixed. 
Manufacturing Many districts reported stable or increased manufacturing 
activity, after the dropback earlier in the year. Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond noted generally rising manufacturing output. Dallas, Philadelphia, and San Francisco pointed to makers of semiconductors, computer products, and other electrical machinery as a major source of strength. Elsewhere-- in Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, and St. Louis--changes in manufacturing activity were mixed, as renewed strength in exports offset slowing domestic demand for some types of goods. 
Real Estate and Construction On balance, residential building activity appears to have 
been little changed this fall, after the summer rebound. However, the pace of residential construction varied widely by 
iii geographic area. In Philadelphia and Richmond, residential 
construction was scaled back. Chicago and Minneapolis finished the peak building season at high levels, and parts of the San Francisco district reported increased residential construction. In Atlanta and Kansas City, multi-family construction strengthened recently, whereas Dallas reported a pickup in construction of single-family units. In many of the areas with increased residential construction, home sales also have improved lately, as buyers took advantage of lower mortgage interest rates. 
Some districts reported strengthening nonresidential construction. St. Louis and San Francisco suggested that there has been a general increase in nonresidential building activity. Atlanta and Richmond pointed to gains in construction of structures for commercial use, whereas Minneapolis noted increased construction of office and warehouse space. Moreover, demand for nonresidential space picked up in Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, St. Louis, and parts of the San Francisco district. In contrast, office and commercial real estate markets were sluggish in Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. 
Services Some districts mentioned increased activity in selected 
service-producing industries. Demand for business services increased in some districts; Dallas and San Francisco noted 
increased demand for legal or financial advice on business 
iv 
transactions, and Boston mentioned a pickup in outsourcing of personnel department functions to temporary help agencies. 
Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco noted gains in tourism. 
Financial Institutions Loan demand reportedly increased in early fall in most 
districts. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco singled out business lending as the primary source of increased loan volumes. New York found that demand for consumer loans also increased in the last two months. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources The recent harvests of many major crops were marked by lower 
than average yields and increases in prices. St. Louis, Kansas City, and other districts noted that yields of corn and soybeans were below average, and prices increased in recent months. Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas also noted that adverse weather and insect problems hurt the cotton crop. In the San Francisco district, yields for selected crops were low too, but some agricultural producers there recently have benefitted from increased exports of apples and other agricultural commodities. 
Wages and Prices Reports of rapidly rising materials costs have lessened, and 
several districts noted a partial reversal of earlier commodity 
V 
price run-ups. Boston mentioned softening of prices of paper packaging materials, metals, and plastics. Cleveland reported a drop in steel prices, after earlier increases. Some finished manufactured goods prices still are under pressure from the earlier runup in costs of intermediate materials. However, reports from several districts suggest that retail goods prices were little changed, and in some cases, discounting this fall was heavier than last year. 
A few districts reported new manifestations of labor market tightness, but overall wage gains apparently remained moderate. The report from the Minnesota district noted that, as it has become harder to attract and keep good workers in that area, some firms have expanded employee eligibility for benefits. Many districts continued to emphasize that skilled workers-- particularly construction workers in fast-growing states and employees in high technology industries--have been commanding larger than average wage gains. In this report, Cleveland also noted that the movement of workers from less-skilled jobs into skilled positions is increasing training costs of employers and 
pushing up wages for less-skilled workers, who reportedly also are in short supply in many parts of that District. In Richmond and Chicago, salaries of workers at temporary help supply agencies were said to have increased particularly fast. Reports from San Francisco suggested that other types of workers are focussing more on job security than on wages, restraining the overall pace of increase in labor compensation rates",0,1
1995-10-31,"On balance, the district reports point to some further expansion in economic activity with no clear change in underlying price pressure. Broadly interpreted, the expansion in business activity is seen as largely the same as in the previous report with minor modifications. Industrial activity appears to have stabilized and in some areas may now be strengthening. Many districts also report a pickup in construction. In sectors where business conditions are reported to be soft, such as retailing and agriculture, the hot, dry summer weather is commonly blamed. Only the New York and Dallas districts characterized business conditions as having deteriorated since the last report. Prices 
There has been little change in price pressures since the last report. Industrial materials prices have slowed from their strong pace in 1994, although higher costs for 
some materials (including paper, certain plastics, and building materials) continue to trouble some manufacturers. Overall, however, industrial cost pressures appear to be relatively minimal. Reduced crop yields have boosted prices for a range of agricultural commodities, and in some cases, such as grains, prices are substantially above levels at this time last year. More generally, consumer price increases are somewhat restrained, and there is little apparent concern about an acceleration in retail price pressures over the immediate term.

Labor Markets 
Few changes in employment conditions are reported. In the New York and Cleveland districts, unemployment has risen, although in the latter instance, the higher rate of joblessness is tied to model-year changeovers in the auto industry. Some labor market tightness is noted, such as for construction workers in the Richmond and San Francisco districts, and in some specific areas of the St. Louis and Dallas districts. By and large, however, the demand for labor is seen as growing moderately with little unusual pressure on wage gains. Retailing 
A preponderance of districts report lackluster retail spending in August. Exceptions are the San Francisco district, where spending has improved after weakening earlier, and the Atlanta region, where a strong pace of back-to-school purchases and optimism over holiday sales are reported. The Philadelphia district notes a typical seasonal increase in retail activity. These reports break from a general pattern of a subdued back-to-school shopping season caused in large part by unusually hot August weather in much of the country. 
Apparel sales are described as soft in a majority of the district reports. August home goods sales were off from July levels in the Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago regions, but stronger in the Kansas City district. Auto sales were mixed by district, showing little propensity to move much in either direction. With a few exceptions (many 
iii districts report high apparel stockpiles), retail inventories are described as being in good 
shape. 
Manufacturing 
The slowing in manufacturing activity reported in the last district summary appears to have leveled off. In some districts, such as Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco, manufacturing activity appears to have strengthened slightly. Only the New York district indicates a continued falloff in overall manufacturing production. Most reports echo the Minneapolis district, where manufacturing sales are described as ""good, but not growing at the pace they were a year ago."" Continued high levels of production are noted in the Cleveland and Kansas City regions, and by sector, demand is strong in the areas of computer, fabricated metals, telecommunications, and electronics manufacturing. Construction and Real Estate 
Among the more favorable developments since the last district summary has been an apparent strengthening in construction activity in many regions. The Chicago and St. 
Louis districts note strong home sales, and Cleveland reports an improvement in residential construction. The Atlanta district indicates that single-family home sales are running ""modestly above year-ago levels"" and that residential construction has improved. Multifamily construction activity has picked up in the Kansas City district, and nonresidential construction has increased in many parts of the Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco districts. 
Agriculture 
Of the seven districts reporting on agricultural conditions, the St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas regions indicate that crops are in good shape, although heat and insect problems have affected some areas. The Kansas City district sees crops in fairly good condition, but their development is two to four weeks behind schedule as a result of spring rains. In the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco districts, dry, harsh weather and other calamities have adversely affected crop yields and pushed some prices higher. In particular, corn, soybean, cotton, peanut, and tobacco harvests are down from last year. Other General Business Conditions 
The tourist season appears to have been a bright spot in many district economies. The New York district describes tourism as brisk, especially from abroad, Philadelphia reports a good season, and Minneapolis sees tourism in its eastern region as having improved. In addition, Minneapolis reports tourism as ""outpacing that of last year,"" as does Richmond, although traffic has apparently fallen off slightly in recent weeks. 
In other sectors, business reports are mixed. Service-sector growth has decreased in the Richmond district, and drilling activity is flat in the Kansas City and Dallas regions. In the Dallas report, however, business services demand is seen as having strengthened, and the San Francisco district reports continued strong demand in service-producing industries. 
Banking and Finance 
Lending activity is reported to have held steady, and in some cases, such as the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts, it has actually grown somewhat further. Consumer borrowing has declined ""considerably"" in the New York district and is characterized as ""soft"" in the Atlanta report, but is growing in many other parts of the country. In two districts, Philadelphia and Cleveland, revolving credit demands are especially strong. Most districts report continued growth in commercial credit demand, while mortgage credit extensions are mixed by region. No deteriorations in credit quality are noted.",0,0
1995-08-31,"Most districts continue to report economic expansion, although in some areas the rate of expansion has moderated recently. The upper Midwest, Southeast and West continue to expand. Other areas are experiencing little or no growth. Expansion of retail sales also varies by geographic region, with the center of the country generally doing somewhat better than other areas. Manufacturing, particularly the auto and construction-related industries, continues to slow in many districts. However, orders are up in some districts, and inventories generally are considered to be at acceptable levels. Reports of tight labor markets come from many districts, but few report increased wage pressures. Three-quarters of the districts continue to report higher prices for raw materials, but the rate of increase is decelerating. Retail prices are generally unchanged or up modestly. In most areas of the country, residential and commercial real estate markets are picking up; loan demand is steady or strengthening. Weather concerns dominate reports from most agricultural-producing districts, while livestock producers face reduced profits because of lower selling prices and higher feed grain prices. Consumer Spending 
Compared with one year ago, retail sales are up slightly in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, New York and St. Louis districts, while the remaining districts report sluggish or declining sales. The Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City and New York districts report strong growth in apparel sales, while the Boston and Dallas districts report either declining or steady apparel sales. Boston also notes that sales of durables are below retailers' expectations. The Philadelphia district reports that discount stores are doing well and that the recent heat wave

ii increased the demand for air conditioners, fans, outdoor furniture and lawn equipment. In general, though, retailers in this district are experiencing their usual seasonal slowdown. The 
Kansas City and New York districts note that sales of home furnishings and home improvement goods are weak, while retailers in the Atlanta district have seen a recent uptick for these products. Most districts report that retailers' inventories are at acceptable levels. Contacts in the Atlanta district expect a good back-to-school season, while St. Louis contacts are 
somewhat more pessimistic. Reports on auto sales are mixed, ranging from sluggish in the Atlanta, Minneapolis and 
San Francisco districts, to above last year's levels in the Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City districts. In the Philadelphia district, increases in auto sales are leveling off from their higher rates earlier in the year, and dealers in the St. Louis district report flat to moderately strong 
growth. In the Chicago district, auto leasing is very strong. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing production continues to slow in most districts. The Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis districts report some slowing, while New York and San Francisco have mixed reports from their contacts. Some districts note that the auto and construction-related industries have slowed recently, with accompanying effects 
on firms that supply these industries. The Atlanta, Chicago and Kansas City districts report some gains in overall production, 
with Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco noting increases in orders. The demand for machinery has jumped significantly in the Boston district. Computer and electronic firms in the Atlanta district indicate that recent increases in orders are adding to their backlogs. Heavy truck manufacturers in the Cleveland district report that a backlog of orders is sustaining their 
iii business. The Chicago district notes a decline in steel demand, while St. Louis is experiencing 
an expansion in the steel industry. Exporters in the Boston district report that even though sales to European markets have 
been sluggish, demand from developing countries has grown substantially. Inventories at firms in the Cleveland and Kansas City districts are at desired levels, but firms in the Atlanta district report that levels remain below those posted earlier in the year. Small high-tech firms in the 
Minneapolis district note expanding activity. 
Labor Markets 
Labor market conditions vary across and within districts. Contacts in the Philadelphia district note that they have trimmed payrolls and reduced hours. Similarly, contacts in the St. Louis district note that the need for temporary workers or overtime has diminished greatly. The New York district says that announcements of employment gains have been mostly offset by recent layoffs. Temporary employment agencies in the Boston, Dallas and Richmond 
districts, however, report strong demand. Firms in more than half of the districts continue to report difficulty hiring and retaining both skilled and entry-level workers. Wages and Prices 
Nearly all districts note that price pressures remain on materials and supplies, with reports of increasing prices generally outnumbering reports of flat or declining prices. Overall, though, the rate of increases appears to be moderating. Despite reports of minimal wage pressures, there are some reported exceptions. In the Dallas and Richmond districts, for example, wages for temporary workers have been accelerating, while in the Chicago and Minneapolis districts, upward pressure on wages for entry-level employees continues. Retail prices in the Kansas City and New York districts are generally unchanged to up slightly, 
iv 
although individual districts report declining apparel and computer prices. Some retailers in the San Francisco district are now tempering their price increases for fear of hurting sales. 
Input price increases at the manufacturing level are more widespread and appear to be most prevalent for raw materials like paper and wood products, chemicals and certain metals. Nine districts report higher input prices; ofthose nine, two-Boston and Cleveland--expect to see higher prices of cotton goods and furniture, respectively, later this year. In the Dallas 
district, on the other hand, recently announced increases in chemical prices have been rescinded, and in the Chicago district, prices for steel and resin have actually declined. Construction and Real Estate 
Residential and commercial real estate markets have improved somewhat in most districts. Contacts in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia and San Francisco districts report recent increases in single-family home construction or sales, while New York and St. Louis report slack activity. Despite recent increases, year-to-date residential construction is still below the records set in many districts in 1994. Recent reductions in mortgage interest rates are credited for the pick-up in new construction and sales. Real estate 
agents in the Philadelphia district report a large inventory of homes for sale, but contacts in the Atlanta district complain of a low inventory. 
Activity in commercial real estate markets, especially industrial markets, continues to increase or hold steady across all reporting districts. Commercial vacancy rates have declined in the Minneapolis and Richmond districts, while holding steady in the Dallas and Philadelphia districts. The multifamily sector is strengthening in the Atlanta, Boston and Dallas districts. New nonresidential construction is reported in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Minneapolis 
districts and in selected portions of the Richmond and San Francisco districts. 
Banking and Finance 
Loandemandappearstobesteadyorrisinginamajorityofdistricts. BoththeAtlanta and St. Louis districts note that competition among lenders on price and credit terms is fierce. Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco report strong commercial and industrial loan demand. Consumer loan growth is reported to be up in the Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City and St. Louis districts. The Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts report increased residential mortgage lending because of home sales, refinancings or both. Commercial real estate lending is reported to be steady in the Dallas and Kansas City districts and weaker in the Atlanta and New York districts. 
Loan delinquencies remain low in the Cleveland, New York and St. Louis districts. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Crops conditions are generally favorable across the nation. Most districts, however, report some form of adverse weather that has led to heightened concerns about the size and qualityofmanycrops,whichsteminpartfromthisyear'sunusuallylatespringplantings. For example, Kansas City reports that weather will need to be ideal for the remainder of the season to produce normal yields for corn and soybeans. Elsewhere, hot, dry weather has affected crops in the Dallas and St. Louis districts, while Chicago, Minneapolis and Richmond report some heat-related losses for poultry and cattle producers. Increasing feed grain prices and 
lower livestock prices have diminished profit levels for livestock producers in the Kansas City and Minneapolis districts; some producers in the Kansas City district plan to reduce the size of their breeding herds in response. With the wheat and small grain harvest complete in many areas, yields are reportedly smaller and of lower quality in the Kansas City district and parts 
vi of the St. Louis district. On the other hand, record or near-record yields are reported in the 
Richmond district and in other parts of the St. Louis district. Energy production has changed little despite lower oil prices. A marked decline in 
crude oil prices has not prevented an increase in oil drilling activity in the Kansas City district. Despite lower natural gas prices in the Dallas district, drilling activity for natural gas is reportedly higher. Minneapolis reports robust growth in its natural resources industries. In particular, copper and wood products producers are operating at capacity, while activity in the San Francisco district's mining industry is increasing.",0,1
1995-07-31,"Economic activity remains at a high level across much of the nation, although there are indications of some softening in many reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts. Activity in interest-sensitive sectors generally remains well below year-earlier levels and continues to decline in some areas. There are regional variations, with strongest growth reported in the center of the country, but generally less favorable conditions on the East and West coasts. Manufacturers of capital goods and electronics continue to report good sales. But producers of some consumer items, automobiles and their components, and building materials report slowing demand. Residential building remains slower than last year, but strength in commercial and other non-residential construction is taking up the slack in some areas. Developments in energy and mining are favorable, but agriculture has been hurt by unfavorable weather and livestock prices. Loan demand is largely flat, with some declines reported in lending rates. Most districts report that non-auto retail sales improved in May from earlier in the year. Auto sales remain depressed, with a few indications of an upturn. Tourism is mixed, with some districts reporting slow business due to unfavorable weather. Labor markets generally remain tight, but little wage pressure is evident. Similarly, price increases for products such as paper and semiconductors have been partially offset by price declines for building materials. 
Manufacturing 
Conditions for manufacturers vary across the country. At the extremes, Philadelphia and Richmond report notable declines, while Boston, Minneapolis and Kansas City describe continued strength. Other districts fall somewhere in between. There are some common threads running through several district reports. Orders for high-tech items appear stronger than for traditional products such as apparel or home furnishings. Chicago notes that a manufacturer of industrial automation equipment has an order ""backlog of Biblical proportions,"" while Dallas and Atlanta describe rising orders for electronic products, semiconductors and telecommunications equipment. San Francisco 
' Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis based on information collected before June 12, 1995. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not 
a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
reports increased capacity utilization and lengthening lead times for makers of electronics components. 
Demand for capital items seems more sustained than for durable consumer goods, particularly for Chicago and Cleveland. Several districts report slowing output of vehicles and their components and a decrease in orders for building materials. Reports on consumer items are mixed; several districts, especially Boston, see weakness in this area. Atlanta notes specific declines in carpet, furniture and some apparel categories. Apparel is also down for St. Louis, but footwear is stable and furniture strong. Within this overall pattern for the manufacturing sector, several districts cite export orders as one source of strength. 
Construction and Real Estate 
Residential construction remains below year-earlier levels in all districts and a few report continuing declines in single-family home activity. But a few others, including Dallas and San Francisco, report gains in home building, and several districts report some degree of optimism on the part of builders with regard to the 1995 construction season. Moreover, multifamily construction activity is buoying some regions, especially St. Louis and San Francisco. Furthermore, in several districts, notably Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco, commercial and other non-residential construction is strong, in some cases fully offsetting any weakness in the residential sector. 
Leasing and sales of existing housing follows a similar checkered pattern. Eastern cities such as Boston, New York and Washington reportedly have weakening rental markets for housing and commercial property, as does Chicago. But Atlanta and San Francisco report strong rental markets in some areas. 
Agriculture 
Conditions are poor for farmers in several districts, largely because of adverse weather. For Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis, the problem is too much 
rain. Corn, soybean and wheat planting has been severely delayed across most of the Midwest and much of the Great Plains, and yield expectations are dropping. Missouri, 
iii 
North Dakota and South Dakota are particularly hard hit. Dallas and Kansas City report that winter wheat is in poor condition due to unfavorable weather earlier in the year. 
Bad weather is also hurting agriculture in the Richmond and Dallas districts, but here the problem is drought and unseasonable heat. The Carolinas and southern Texas are particularly hard hit. Livestock prices remain depressed. Kansas City reports higher than normal levels of farm loan refinancing, largely as a result of losses in the livestock industry. 
Cleveland, which describes producers as expecting excellent harvests, is one bright spot in the agricultural sector. San Francisco, which reports strong growth in exports of fruit and other agricultural products, is another. 
In other natural resource sectors, Dallas and Minneapolis report increased oil and gas activity, but Kansas City notes continuation of a half-year decline in drilling. For Dallas, the increase is concentrated offshore, while for Minneapolis production drilling into a new formation has led to a minor boom in North Dakota and Montana. Minneapolis also reports high production in iron and non-ferrous metal mining, and good business for paper mills and loggers in spite of a price slump for lumber producers. 
Financial Institutions and Credit 
Most districts report flat to slight increases in loan demand. One exception is San Francisco where growth is strong throughout the district, with improvements in real estate and construction lending in California. Loan demand softened somewhat in Cleveland, although new mortgage lending and mortgage refinancing have improved with declining rates. Loan demand is mixed in Atlanta, with moderate to strong activity in commercial real estate, industrial and general business lending, and slower activity in consumer lending, especially auto loans. 
Loan rates decreased slightly in several districts. Average loan rates declined at about 60 percent of small and mid-size banks in the New York district. In Richmond rates fell slightly for consumer and commercial loans and fell sharply for mortgage loans. Kansas City reports little change in rates. 
Consumer Spending and Tourism 
General retail sales improved slightly in May compared to April in most districts. Exceptions include New York and Minneapolis where sales show moderate growth and Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco where sales are sluggish. In Boston sales are up 1percent to 10 percent over year-earlier levels, though retailers view the second half with uncertainty. Computers and telecommunications equipment are selling well in Cleveland, while home improvement products are moving slowly. A large retailer in Chicago reports that sales of appliances and home electronics exceeded average for May and June, while apparel sales also strengthened. 
Auto sales are slow in many districts. Sales are described as significantly lower than year-earlier levels in Cleveland and Dallas, while waning in St. Louis. Kansas City dealers report flat or declining sales for the past month. Sales continue somewhat below last year's pace in Minneapolis, but there are signs of an upturn. Chicago dealers report that sales are up for May and early June, compared to April, and they expect a small gain in the latter half of 1995. 
Tourism is mixed across districts. Activity for May was above April and year-earlier levels in Richmond. Tourism in Florida is spotty, but growing in the rest of the Atlanta district. Cold weather has slowed activity in Minneapolis, while San Francisco service industries report continued strong demand. 
Labor Markets 
Labor markets remain tight. Employment growth remains robust, Minneapolis notes, and several New York small business executives relate difficulty in attracting and 
retaining skilled workers. Many areas of the St. Louis district are still experiencing tight labor markets, particular for entry-level positions, and have relaxed hiring standards. 
One-third of manufacturing firms surveyed by Boston have current openings or hiring plans. Help-wanted advertising and demand for temporary workers are strong in the 
Chicago district. Philadelphia, however, notes that area manufacturers plan to trim payrolls. 
Wages and Prices 
Notwithstanding taut labor markets, wage pressures are muted. Reports of wage increases remain scattered, according to Kansas City, and recent wage agreements 
specify increases in the 2 percent to 3 percent range in the Minneapolis district. Wage increases remain generally stable, states Atlanta. Moreover, although district labor markets remain tight, Chicago reports that a slowing of expansion in the demand for labor may have eased wage pressures in recent months. 
While prices continue to increase, the rate of increase has recently diminished, according to Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Richmond. Some of this easing relates to the letup in home-building as Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis and San Francisco report a softening in building material prices. Atlanta's apparel and carpet producers are having trouble passing on higher material prices to consumers. Only 10 percent of manufacturers are raising prices on their own products, according to a Philadelphia survey. Semiconductor prices, however, have accelerated, states Dallas, while Boston, Kansas City and Minneapolis report price increases for packaging materials. But according to Dallas, manufacturers of paper and corrugated boxes said that selling prices have flattened, which may signal easing cost pressures in coming months.",1,1
1995-05-31,"Most Federal Reserve District Banks reported continuing gains in economic activity from March through April, but at a somewhat slower pace. Overall business conditions were described as improving solidly in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. Growth was reported to be continuing at a somewhat slower pace by Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Business activity was described as mixed in New York and less strong in Philadelphia. Most Districts reported sluggish growth in retail sales and declines in automobile sales, while manufacturing was up by 
varying degrees in most Districts. Although reports of rising commodity and industrial prices remain 
widespread, except for construction materials, reports from many Districts described these increases as moderate or not accelerating or indicated that they were not being passed through to finished goods prices. In addition, despite tight labor markets in some sectors or regions, wage pressures were described as 
moderate in most areas. Retail 
Most Districts reported sluggish growth in general merchandise sales, although Chicago and Minneapolis reported improved sales and a few Districts (New York, Cleveland, and Atlanta) noted some improvement in April compared to March. 
Richmond indicated that sales growth was slowing. In the Boston and Philadelphia Districts sales were mixed and generally below expectations. Store inventories

ii were on the rise, according to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco. Auto sales softened in all Districts except Dallas. Some weakening in sales of 
home furnishings and consumer durables was also reported. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity remained strong in Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Continuing, but smaller, gains were reported by Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis. Demand was strong for capital goods, electronics, and petrochemicals. However, even in Districts with increases in overall manufacturing, demand for construction materials was easing. 
San Francisco District manufacturers reported mixed results. Aerospace and lumber companies experienced declining demand, while producers of electronic goods, machinery, and aluminum increased output. Overall manufacturing activity declined in the Philadelphia District. Real Estate and Construction 
Commercial real estate activity was improving in most Districts. Office leasing and construction were reported on the rise by Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Dallas and Minneapolis noted increased construction of warehouses. Nonresidential construction was mixed in the San Francisco District, moving up 
outside of California, particularly in Nevada and Alaska, but easing in the Los Angeles area. Boston and New York gave mixed reports; gains in some parts of 
those Districts were offset by declines in others. Residential construction or sales were up somewhat in the Chicago and 
Kansas City Districts, but were slipping in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reported slower growth in residential construction. Multifamily construction was increasing, according to Atlanta and 
Dallas, but real estate contacts in those Districts expressed concern that 
iii apartments were approaching an overbuilt situation. 
Banking Overall bank lending was increasing moderately in most Districts, with 
gains most often noted in commercial and industrial lending. All five District Banks that reported on consumer lending (Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco) noted drops in the demand for consumer loans. New York, Richmond, and St. Louis reported increased real estate lending. Lending terms in April were reported to be substantially the same as earlier in the year, but competition for business loans remains strong. 
Agriculture Several Districts noted some concern in agricultural areas about the 
outlook for summer crops because planting has been delayed. Cold and wet weather has caused postponements in planting in the Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, while dry weather has affected parts of the Richmond 
and Dallas Districts. According to agricultural contacts in Minneapolis, the delay could curtail crop yields later this year regardless of weather conditions during the summer. But the winter wheat crop is in good condition, according to reports received by St. Louis and Kansas City. Floods in California have damaged vegetable, fruit, and nut crops, according to information obtained by San Francisco, and some crop prices are expected to remain high through mid-summer. Both Kansas City and Dallas report falling livestock prices. 
Tourism Spring tourism business has picked up in the Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, 
and San Francisco Districts, and part of the Atlanta District. Tour agencies and hoteliers in these regions expect a good summer. Boston and Atlanta both noted an increase in international visitors to some tourist regions. Atlanta also 
iv noted, however, that a weakening of tourism in southern Florida has been attributed to the drop in the value of the peso. Boston also was told that 
spending by domestic tourists appears to be off from prior years. Energy and Mining 
Recent increases in oil prices have boosted drilling activity a bit, according to the Kansas City, Dallas, and Minneapolis Districts. But a relatively mild winter depressed demand for natural gas, and natural gas prices and production remain weak. 
Minneapolis reported that rising demand for gold and copper was prompting output and employment increases in the District. San Francisco also reported 
increased production from gold and silver mines. Prices 
Except for prices of materials used in residential construction, reports of rising commodity and industrial prices remain widespread, although many Districts described these increases as moderate or not accelerating (including Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Richmond) or indicated that they were not being passed through to finished goods prices (including Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas). Chicago was the only District that reported that input 
price increases were more frequently being passed through to final goods prices. While some business contacts told District Banks that the rise in commodity prices appeared to be slowing, Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland reported the range of commodities affected by the increases was expanding. Cleveland and Kansas City contacts said retail prices were steady, while Richmond contacts reported higher retail prices. 
Wages 
Tight labor markets in some sectors or regions were reported by Cleveland, 
v 
Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas, but wage increases were described as moderate in most of these areas, and Kansas City noted few reports of wage increases. Demand in some Districts for both skilled and semi-skilled workers, as well as technical and managerial workers, was strong. Labor markets appeared to be less tight in the Philadelphia District, where manufacturers reduced work forces in April, and in the Boston District, where business contacts gave no reports of labor shortages or growing wage pressures.",0,1
1995-04-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts suggest that the pace of the economic expansion has moderated over the 
past two months. Half the districts note that growth has slowed, while the remaining districts generally report that conditions are mixed. Retail sales and residential construction weakened across much of the country. In contrast, manufacturing continued to grow in all but one of the regions and labor markets remained strong. Although commodity prices continued to rise, several districts note that the rate of increase has decelerated. There is little evidence that strength in labor markets or increases in commodity prices have spilled over into wages or prices of finished goods. 
Retail Recent reports suggest that retail sales growth, measured on 
a year-over-year basis, slowed in over two-thirds of the districts. Retailers in Boston report sales were flat or declining for a broad range of merchandise, including winter apparel, housewares, and sports equipment. Minneapolis cites news reports of a ""retail slump,"" while retailers in both the Dallas and San Francisco regions report that sales declined along the Mexican border because of the weak peso. While two districts

ii report noticeably stronger retail sales growth, they note that 
much of the strength is attributable to special factors -- weather in New York and clearance promotions in Kansas City. Retail inventories have increased beyond planned levels in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas districts. Auto sales have generally weakened; dealers in the San Francisco region are using rebates and other incentives to bolster sales. Manufacturing 
Growth in the manufacturing sector has generally remained strong since the beginning of the year. Manufacturing strengthened in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas, while remaining robust in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City. Sources in Minneapolis describe the strongest manufacturing performance in recent years. Boston, New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco report that conditions were mixed, with weakness in some segments of manufacturing offsetting strength in others. The sector continued to grow but at a slower pace in St. Louis. Preliminary results of Richmond's survey of manufacturers show that new orders, backlogs, and employment indexes were down slightly in February from their January levels. Contacts in three of the districts expect the pace of manufacturing growth to moderate in coming months. 
Capital goods industries have been particularly robust. Cleveland reports that orders of capital goods, led by strength 
in export markets, have continued to grow strongly. In St. Louis, exports of capital goods included construction equipment 
iii shipped to Japan in the wake of the Kobe earthquake. Computer 
equipment, pulp and paper products, and electronics are also repeatedly cited as sources of manufacturing strength. Examples of manufacturing weakness include the aerospace industry (Boston and San Francisco), automobiles and auto supplies (Boston and Chicago), and apparel (Atlanta and Dallas). Construction and Real Estate 
Construction of single-family homes continued to slow from 1994 levels across much of the country. Atlanta, St. Louis, 
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco report that homebuilding declined, while Philadelphia and Minneapolis report that activity 
leveled off. Looking forward, however, contacts in a third of the districts expect demand to strengthen later this spring. In contrast to the weakness in single-family homes, the construction of multifamily housing increased in both the Atlanta and Kansas City regions. 
Reports on commercial construction are more upbeat. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas note an increase in commercial construction, driven by such diverse factors as a scarcity of large blocks of contiguous office space (Atlanta), expansion of manufacturing capacity 
(Chicago), and increased demand for warehouse space 
(Minneapolis). Reports on commercial real estate markets are mixed, however. The market softened for office space in midtown Manhattan. Philadelphia notes that its office market remains 
iv weak, although demand for industrial space has firmed. Within 
the San Francisco region, commercial real estate markets are weak in California but strong elsewhere. Banking and Finance 
Loan demand was steady or higher in nearly all of the districts. The strength in lending was primarily attributable to commercial and industrial loans. In contrast, New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City report that residential mortgage lending slowed as the housing sector cooled; Cleveland notes that mortgage refinancing is at a standstill. Consumer lending -- especially automobile loans -- weakened in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis while remaining flat in Richmond and Dallas. 
Agriculture Favorable weather conditions coupled with increases in crop 
and livestock prices brightened the outlook for farm incomes. Chicago reports that market conditions in the agricultural sector 
held up better than expected. Mild winter weather benefitted livestock production in the Richmond and Minneapolis districts. St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco note that strong domestic demand coupled with reduced foreign supply boosted cotton prices. Prices and Wages 
Although commodity prices have continued to rise, several districts report that the rate of increase seems to have eased. Boston notes that some suppliers of steel and chemicals are now offering customer rebates to soften the impact of price 
v 
increases. Contacts in Cleveland report a moderation in the rate of increase of industrial commodity prices. Fewer manufacturers in Minneapolis report delivery delays, while manufacturers in Dallas expect price pressures to ease in coming months. In contrast, Chicago sees little evidence that manufacturers' input prices have ebbed and notes that recovery abroad may put upward pressure on commodity prices by tightening import supplies. 
In general, the districts report that increases in commodity prices have not spilled over into prices of finished goods. Boston notes that finished goods prices have generally remained stable, with increases for some products offset by decreases for others. Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas report that intense competition among retailers kept prices flat despite increased input costs. 
Labor market conditions are generally strong. Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis report that labor markets have remained tight. A survey by a large temporary help firm in Chicago showed further strengthening in employers' hiring plans after record high levels late last year. Similarly, Minneapolis notes shortages of skilled workers, particularly in manufacturing. New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City report spot shortages of labor. In contrast, manufacturers hiring for replacement purposes in the Boston region had little difficulty finding qualified workers. Despite the strength in labor markets, the districts report little evidence of upward pressure on wages.",0,1
1995-02-28,"Summary. Economic expansion remained vibrant around much of the nation in recent months, and conditions seem to have grown more uniform among the Districts. The underlying momentum in consumer spending growth remained quite strong. Manufacturers continued to offer some of the brightest reports within the Districts, although the overall pace of expansion in industrial output may have eased somewhat. Assessments of auto industry conditions remained upbeat. Higher mortgage interest rates appear to have slowed single-family housing activity, but multifamily residential and commercial construction remained relatively strong. Expansion in bank loans slowed, led by weaker demand for home mortgage, home equity, and residential construction loans. Production responses to livestock price declines are anticipated to bolster farm income in the current year. Labor markets continued to strengthen, with most reports indicating unchanged to somewhat higher wage increases. Price increases seemed somewhat more widespread than were reported in early December, while higher inflationary expectations were apparent in business surveys. 
Retail Sales. Retail sales increased at a moderate pace in the holiday season. Sales gains may have fallen modestly below expectations formed just after the Thanksgiving weekend, but weather effects 
and other factors point to stronger underlying momentum in spending growth. Nearly every District reported continued strength in sales gains for hard goods and/or big-ticket items, including personal 
computers, other consumer electronics items, home furnishings and appliances. Assessments of auto sales remained quite positive in much of the nation. Apparel sales were weaker in normally cold Districts that experienced relatively warm winter weather, and many apparel retailers reported heavier-than- anticipated discounting. However, there were signs of underlying strength even in the apparel category. Several Districts in the northern part of the country noted that apparel sales weakness was concentrated in outerwear, while retailers in the Atlanta District noted that warmer-than-usual weather held back overall holiday sales gains, except for apparel,which showed relatively strong gains.

outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Manufacturing. Manufacturers continued to provide some of the strongest reports within the Districts, although the overall growth rate may have slowed modestly. Philadelphia's survey of manufacturers showed output continuing to grow in the fourth quarter, although somewhat more slowly than a strong year-earlier period; looking ahead, about twice as many respondents expected order increases than decreases during the first half of 1995. Richmond's mail survey also suggested that most manufacturers expect further gains in output, with little change in the pace of current growth reported since the last survey. Purchasing managers' surveys in the Chicago region pointed to vigorous gains in industrial output as 1994 came to a close, although expansion was not quite so strong as earlier in the year. 
Production and orders trends in durable goods industries continued to lead growth within the overall manufacturing sector. Cleveland's industrial contacts indicated that orders growth remains solid, with particular strength in capital goods industries. Automotive contacts reported some of the strongest sales gains within Boston's manufacturing sector. Cleveland and Chicago reported strength in demand for steel, with Chicago noting that steel output plans for the first quarter were recently increased in response to stronger automotive orders. Auto parts suppliers continued to announce construction of new production facilities in the Atlanta region. Increased exports to Europe boosted recent results among Cleveland's manufacturing contacts. Uncertainty over Mexican developments clouded expectations in several regions, however. 
Construction and Real Estate. Higher mortgage interest rates appear to have slowed homebuilding and residential real estate activity around much of the nation. Seasonal patterns account for some of the recent weakness, but home sales weakened in normally cold regions that enjoyed relatively warm and favorable weather. Multifamily and commercial construction were stronger than single-family homebuilding in nearly every District. For example, Dallas reported that overall demand for construction-related products edged up; lumber producers reported lower sales for residential building but increased orders for commercial construction, and glass producers reported record sales partly for the same reason. Declining commercial vacancy rates were widely reported, and continued growth in commercial and multifamily development was generally anticipated in 1995. However, a wider group of 
iii 
contacts expressed concern about the future impact of higher interest rates on real estate and commercial construction activity. 
Banking. Expansion in bank loans slowed, led by weaker demand for home mortgage, home equity, and residential construction loans. Most Districts indicated that commercial and industrial loan demand remains relatively strong. ""Outside of housing,"" San Francisco noted, ""bank lending activity is reported to be brisk."" A number of Districts reported slower growth or declines in business loan demand, however. After a relatively strong group of reports in December, assessments of trends in consumer loan demand were mixed, with some new slowing apparent even in Districts with relatively strong retail sales gains. Wherever noted, delinquency rates continued to decline. Philadelphia characterized loan officers' outlooks as ""positive but cautious,"" with overall loan growth expected to ease as the year progresses. Reports of tighter lending margins were noted in several Districts, and Philadelphia stated that officers may review future lending plans as a result. Agricultural banks in the Kansas City District reported that crop loans were in better condition than a year ago, while a slump in hog and cattle prices weighed on livestock loan quality. 
Agriculture. Production responses to livestock price declines are anticipated to help bring some recovery in farm income in the current year. Kansas City reported that bankers generally expect farm income to improve slightly in its region during 1995, assuming normal crop yields, as livestock prices are anticipated to return to break-even levels. Chicago noted that hog production was up only marginally from last year and well short of expectations. Producers in the Chicago region account for a substantial share of national output, and they have made sizable cuts in planned production. Minneapolis noted that modest recent improvement in livestock prices have improved producer outlooks for 1995, and there are signs of increased farmer willingness to invest in new machinery. 
Labor Markets. Continued strengthening and/or increasingly tight labor markets were widely noted, although a minority of Districts suggested that wage pressures may have eased in some occupations. Minneapolis stated that ""evidence of tight labor markets abounds."" Retailers in the St. Louis and Chicago Districts reported difficulty meeting holiday seasonal labor needs, and St. Louis found that retailers were actively recruiting personnel from other stores. Strong demand for temporary workers was reported in the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts, with Dallas also noting increasing wage 
pressures for temporary labor. Chicago reported that shortages of machine tool operators caused some production bottlenecks, and prompted some capital spending delays because workers were not available to operate new machinery. Reports on permanent manufacturing employment trends were mixed; growth was noted by contacts in Cleveland, Chicago and Richmond, while employment seemed to remain relatively flat among manufacturers contacted by Boston and Philadelphia. At the same time, Boston reported a tighter market for clerical workers, with increased opportunities for permanent employment. New York reported significant job cut announcements in the financial services sector. 
Increasing wage pressures were reported more frequently in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while Kansas City stated that tightness in markets for skilled manufacturing and construction labor had eased. Surveys by compensation consulting companies in the Chicago region suggest that salary increases for exempt salaried employees of large firms will remain in line with 1994, while pay varying with sales growth, profitability, customer service, or other organizational goals will continue to take an increased share of total compensation. 
Prices. The pace of price increases seemed steady to somewhat higher since reports in early December, while higher inflationary expectations were apparent in business surveys conducted in San Francisco and Chicago. District reports continued to emphasize shortages and increasing input prices in manufacturing and construction, coupled with stability in most retail prices. Price discounting during the holiday season ran heavier than many retailers had anticipated, particularly in apparel. 
Manufacturers continued to report strong (but perhaps diminishing) pressure against output price increases. Boston stated that long-term agreements with suppliers, low labor cost increases, pressure 
from customers and greater operating efficiency continue to limit many manufacturers' needs for output price increases. Reports from a minority of Districts included a growing set of exceptions to this rule, however. 
Retailers in Dallas and San Francisco noted higher price pressures from rising packaging costs. Labor shortages and strong demand increased price pressures among service firms in the Dallas region. 
Agricultural businesses in the San Francisco region expressed concern about rising labor, transportation, packaging, and raw materials costs.",0,1
1994-11-30,"Economic activity continues to expand in all Federal Reserve districts, according to business contacts; there are signs of acceleration in the Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia districts, while growth has slowed somewhat in the New York district. Consumer spending generally remains strong. Many districts report increased spending, but several districts report flat or slackening retail sales. Auto sales remain very strong. Manufacturing activity increased in nearly all districts, and demand for business services, 
where reported, has accelerated. Single-family construction has declined from fairly high levels across much of the 
country. Most districts report gains in commercial real estate activity. Loan demand is advancing at a healthy pace in most districts. 
Better-than-expected crop yields have added to record-breaking crop and livestock production nationwide, and large supplies have pushed down agricultural prices. Energy 
activity has improved, despite relatively weak oil and natural gas prices. Labor markets are tight or tightening in most districts, although tightness is limited to 
specific sectors. There are a few reports of rising wages. Prices of raw and intermediate materials continue to rise, and there are increasing reports that manufacturers are passing 
along these costs by raising selling prices. Most districts report no change in retail prices, although pressure is building in some districts. 
'Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and based on information collected before October 25, 1994. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary of the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Consumer Spending Consumer spending (which includes automobiles) has picked up in many districts and 
is strong in most. Auto sales continue to be very strong across the country, and many dealers still complain that inventory shortages are curtailing sales of popular models. Generally, however, retailers are comfortable with inventory levels. Retail sales were unchanged or below expectations in the Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, and Richmond districts. Demand continues to be strongest for durable goods, such as furniture, appliances, and electronics. Several districts report weak apparel sales, particularly women's clothing. Contacts in the Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, and New York districts suggest that unseasonably warm weather 
in September contributed to slow apparel sales. Retailers are optimistic about holiday retail sales growth in the Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco 
districts. 
Manufacturing Manufacturing activity has increased in all districts, and only Atlanta and Richmond 
note a slowing rate of growth since the last Beige Book. Demand remains particularly strong for heavy-duty trucks, automotive inputs and parts, steel, home appliances, electronics, furniture, chemicals, paper, and packaging. Several districts report that pulp, paper, and newsprint inventories are low, and food producers in the Dallas and San Francisco districts note higher packaging costs. In most districts, manufacturers have indicated that input prices are rising, and there are increasing reports that manufacturers are passing these costs along to consumers through higher selling prices. 
ii 
The San Francisco district reports continued weakness in the commercial aerospace industry, and in the Boston district, demand for aircraft parts has dropped at double-digit rates. In Central Florida, defense manufacturers' ongoing downsizing and the space industry's cutbacks are slowing economic activity. 
The apparel sector continues to shrink in the Atlanta district. Apparel demand is steady in Dallas, and producers are optimistic in the St. Louis district. Services 
In those districts reporting on the service sector, activity appears to be accelerating. Demand for business services has increased in the Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Richmond, and 
San Francisco districts. Temporary service firms continue to report the strongest growth. Tourist activity is reported to be very high in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Richmond, and San Francisco districts. Construction and Real Estate 
Single-family construction continues to decline in most districts, but activity remains at fairly high levels in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts and parts of the St. Louis district. Sales of existing homes also have slipped in several districts, but sales were reported as brisk in the St.Louis district and strong in the city of Philadelphia. Home prices are reported as stable or lower in the Atlanta, Boston, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Richmond districts. 
Commercial real estate markets have strengthened in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts, and construction is reported as increasing in many of these markets. Lower vacancy rates are reported for office markets in the Atlanta, Chicago, 
iv Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts, and markets for multifamily real estate have 
tightened in the Atlanta and Dallas districts. 
Banking and Finance Loan demand is advancing at a healthy pace across the country. Most districts report 
solid gains in commercial and industrial lending, but residential mortgage and refinancing activity continued to slow or decline in many districts. Consumer lending is increasing modestly in many parts of the country but has declined moderately in the Richmond district. Competition among banks for loan customers is squeezing margins in several districts, but most bankers report no change in credit standards. The San Francisco district reports weak bank employment as part of consolidations and other cost-cutting efforts. The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts report that increased competition for deposits is placing upward pressure on funding costs. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources Better-than-expected crop yields to several districts are adding to record-breaking crop 
and livestock production nationwide. High crop yields are straining grain storage and handling facilities and pushing prices to very low levels. Record levels of production also have pushed down livestock prices, and the Chicago district reports that hog prices have reached the lowest level in fourteen years. The Chicago and Minneapolis districts expect low prices to limit farm household income andcapital spending. 
The Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts report that energy activity has improved, despite relatively weak oil and natural gas prices. On-shore drilling in the Dallas and Kansas City districts is reported to be below year-ago levels, although drilling activity 
v was strong in the Gulf of Mexico, where the number of working rigs is the highest since 
1990. Mines in the Minneapolis district are reported to be running at capacity. Prices and Wages 
Reports of labor market tightness have increased in most districts, but they are limited to specific sectors. There are a few reports of rising wages. The Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, and St. Louis districts report tighter labor markets, although wages are not reported to be rising. In a few parts of the Atlanta district, labor market tightness is making it difficult for firms in the retail, service, and light industrial sectors to attract and retain employees. Cleveland reports labor shortages in the industrial sector, while 
Dallas reports hiring difficulties at temporary and trucking firms and in large metropolitan areas. A few manufacturers in the Kansas City district report shortages of skilled labor, and 
many contacts in the St. Louis district report a shortage of qualified workers for both permanent and seasonal work. 
Labor market tightness has led to rising wages only in the Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. San Francisco reports tight labor markets, especially for the retail 
and service sectors, and wages are rising at food stores and for experienced computer programmers. The San Francisco district also reports a shortage of skilled construction 
workers in Idaho, Oregon, and Utah, where wages are increasing rapidly. Most districts continue to report that prices of raw and intermediate materials are 
rising, particularly prices of chemicals, plastic, paper, steel, and cotton. Prices of medical and computer equipment continue to decline, however. The Dallas, Philadelphia, and Richmond districts report that higher costs are being passed along through manufacturers' 
vi selling prices. A growing number of factory contacts in the Atlanta and Cleveland districts 
expect cost pressures to be reflected in finished goods prices soon. Most districts report that retail prices have not risen. In the Atlanta district, however, pressures are growing, and in the Dallas district, retail prices are continuing to fall but at a slower pace.",1,0
1994-10-31,"Economic activity continued to expand through the summer, according to reports from businesses in most Federal Reserve Districts. Regions that have been lagging are generally said to be doing better while most of the stronger areas saw growth plateau. The expansion in consumer spending is seen as healthy, albeit decelerating, and retailers' expectations for holiday sales are generally favorable. Summer tourism activity has generally been strong, outpacing last year's levels. Most manufacturers around the country continued to report at least moderate strength. Single-family home sales were seen as slowing modestly in most Districts, with home construction easing in some areas. At the same time, commercial real estate conditions were generally described as improved. Overall bank loan demand appears to be modestly increasing, but higher interest rates are reported to be slowing real estate lending in most areas. There are 
more reports of tightening labor markets than before, though wage pressures are still described as modest. Industrial materials prices edged up further, but businesses say that competitive pressures continue to restrain price increases on finished goods. Farm contacts report that crop 
conditions in most agricultural areas are favorable and point toward an excellent fall harvest. 
CONSUMER SPENDING 
Retail sales reports are mixed but generally positive. The majority of retailers report that sales continue to grow, while some characterize conditions as slow. St. Louis retailers saw year- over-year sales growth of 4 to 5 percent, but these figures fell short of their expectations. Stores

officials. 
ii in both the Atlanta and Philadelphia Districts reported that back-to-school sales were mixed. 
Contacts in the majority of Districts suggested that retail prices were remaining stable because of intense competition. Expectations for the holiday season are generally good. Retailers in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis Districts expect modest increases over last year's sales figures, while both Boston and Philadelphia contacts were hesitant to predict results for the remainder of the year. Retailers in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts say that they are expanding inventories for the upcoming holiday season, while those in New York believe that inventories are about right. 
Automobile dealers in most Districts report that demand is strong, but those in Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis say that a limited supply of autos on the lot is restricting sales. Dallas dealers report that although sales have slowed they are still above year-ago levels. The Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts expect sales to remain healthy as long as 
inventories hold out. 
TOURISM 
Tourist activity over the summer has been generally good. In the Minneapolis District, hotel/motel occupancies, campground, and attraction traffic were above last year's levels. Tourism was especially strong in Boston, boosted by large conventions and international visitors. Traffic on Mississippi's Gulf Coast was reportedly heavy because of casino gambling attractions, but Florida tourism officials remain concerned about a sustained slowdown in visitor arrivals. Most of the San Francisco District saw an influx of foreign tourists taking advantage of the level of the dollar. 
iv Less positively, some industrial sectors have shown little improvement. One aerospace 
supplier in the San Francisco District reports that its backlogs have increased in the past year, but they remain well below levels seen two years ago. Atlanta says that regional military contractors see orders declining and are concerned about future prospects. Manufacturing increased at a sluggish pace in Richmond and factory orders decelerated slightly in the Dallas region. Boston and Atlanta manufacturers indicate that orders for some types of apparel and textiles remain weak. 
On the whole, service firms saw increased demand in most Districts. Dallas reports that demand for business services accelerated there, with temporary staffing and trucking firms noting 
the strongest gains. 
REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Contacts in most Districts note a slowdown in single-family home sales. At the same time, the New York and Richmond Districts continue to report little change. Home prices are reported to be on the rise in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while contacts in the Dallas and Richmond Districts report prices remain unchanged. However, in Dallas, although home prices are steady, builders were said to be offering more discounts and incentives, such as free pools. Home builders in the Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco regions said that residential construction slowed, while those in the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, and St. Louis Districts said the pace of such construction had increased. 
Nationally, commercial real estate agents report improving conditions. However, realtors in the downtown areas of Dallas and Boston note that markets in those cities remain particularly weak while the surrounding suburbs are improving. Construction of retail stores is dominating 
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES 
Steady to improving factory activity characterized most Districts' reports and comments on the near-term industrial outlook remained upbeat. Most firms are operating at high levels of capacity in the Kansas City District, and manufacturing activity remains vigorous in Chicago amid reports that capacity restraints are limiting production in some cases. Auto-related activity has rebounded from the summer slowdown in the Cleveland District, and suppliers to that industry note solid production gains in August. Forecasts by plant managers are generally positive in Philadelphia, where producers of durable goods report improving conditions. Firms in the St. Louis District note moderate growth, and those in Minneapolis say that producers of industrial machinery, farm implements, and construction-related products are posting strong sales. The San Francisco and Boston Districts commented on strong orders for computers, while 
electronic and telecommunications equipment demand is growing in Dallas. Although factory activity is mixed in Atlanta, most industrial contacts there expect to see increasing orders over the next few months; activity is currently rising at paper and some textile mills. Boston, Dallas, and Atlanta report that suppliers to the auto and light truck industry increased production in August, and in some cases expanded operations. 
A number of manufacturers of heavy equipment and building materials have announced capacity expansion projects in the Chicago District. In the Kansas City region, manufacturers purchasing construction materials, such as cement and lumber, are facing longer delivery times. Dallas reports that the demand for chemicals is outstripping available capacity. Although overall manufacturers' shipments and new orders have evidently slowed in the Richmond District, exports have increased. 
v the markets in the Atlanta, Dallas, and Richmond Districts. Multifamily occupancy rates and 
rental rates have been on the rise throughout the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. 
BANKING AND FINANCE 
Banks around the country reported that overall loan demand was steady or up modestly. Business lending was the strongest, with only banks in the St. Louis District reporting softer loan demand. Several contacts noted, however, that competition for commercial loan customers was intense. Consumer lending was said to be stronger in the Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis Districts, while bankers noted decreases in the Atlanta, New York, and Richmond Districts. Real estate and mortgage lending activity is down in most areas. WAGES AND PRICES 
Labor markets seem to be steady or tightening in all areas. San Francisco reports that, outside of California, labor demand appears to be accelerating a bit in the District. Worker shortages are said to be growing increasingly frequent in the Chicago District and some contacts in the St. Louis and Atlanta Districts were also having trouble finding qualified workers. Temporary placement firms reported rising wages in the Chicago District and shortages of skilled construction and clerical workers in several Districts are putting upward pressure on area wages. Price increases have been reported for inputs of raw and intermediate materials. Prices of industrial commodities and building materials continue to trend upward in the Chicago and New York Districts. Atlanta contacts note that price increases for raw materials are becoming more wide spread, especially for paper, metals, and building products. Respondents in Philadelphia and San Francisco also report an upward movement in industrial prices. Boston and Dallas firms say 
that prices are increasing for fiber and paper, respectively. Minneapolis respondents see little 
vi pressure on prices except for petroleum products and newsprint. The competitive environment 
is holding finished goods prices down, according to contacts in Atlanta and Chicago. 
AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE-RELATED INDUSTRIES 
Farm sources say crops for the upcoming fall harvest are generally in good-to-excellent condition. Yields are expected in the good-to-record range for most plantings. Reports from Chicago indicate that a bumper fall harvest appears to be in store for District farmers. In the Kansas City region, corn and soybean yields are expected to approach record levels. Farmers in the Dallas District expect production of corn, sorghum, rice, peanuts, and soybeans to be higher than last year. However, sentiment across the country is that farm incomes will not rise with the favorable harvest because of lower commodity prices. The forest products industry in the Minneapolis District is reportedly being buoyed by continued strength in nationwide construction. Dallas reports that the decline in oil prices was expected, but contacts were surprised at the fall in natural gas prices. Energy-related activity there, as well as the Kansas City District, was seasonally slow and below last year's levels.",1,1
1994-08-31,"Business activity in most areas is continuing to expand at a solid pace, although a number of Districts report scattered indications of some slowing or slight declines. Retail 
activity, which had moderated during the spring, appears to have picked up recently. Most Districts report sales of autos, building materials, and apparel are improved since 
their June report. Several Districts are reporting a tightening in labor markets that, in some cases at 
least, has resulted in faster wage growth. However, labor shortages appear to be concentrated only in a few skilled occupations. The range of commodities for which 
prices are rising appears to have broadened somewhat. However, a majority of Districts report that retailers are holding the line on price increases, and profit margins are narrowing in a retail environment that continues to be characterized as intensely competitive. 
Loan demand appears to be fairly strong in most Districts. Commercial and industrial borrowing has improved in many regions and consumer lending is particularly active. Even in California, where the business trend remains flat, a moderate expansion in lending activity is reported to be underway. 
Business Activity Virtually all Districts are seeing an expansion of industrial activity, with only 
scattered observations of weakness. Industries such as motor vehicles, capital goods including industrialmachinery, heavy trucks, microelectronics, computers, mining and

ii construction equipment, and nondurable goods producers like chemicals and textiles, are 
all reported to be expanding their production. Construction activity appears to be holding steady, although a drop-off in 
residential construction was prominently noted in many District reports. Higher mortgage interest rates are commonly blamed for a slowdown in home sales and new construction, although the Dallas District also notes a very low inventory of new homes. At least a share of the slower residential construction activity appears to have been offset by moderately stronger commercial building. 
Retail markets are, in most regions, stronger than in the spring, particularly inthe areas of autos, building materials, and appliances. Even apparel sales are noted as having improvedsincetheJunereport,althoughnotinallDistricts. Severalregionsalsoreporta reasonably busy tourist season. 
Although activity has improved in retailing, competitive pressures have kept profit margins lean-discounts and promotions are frequently noted. Retailers are guardedly optimistic about prospects over the remainder ofyear, with continued strength anticipated in the new car market. There also appears to be a growing enthusiasm over the coming back-to-school season. 
Prices Price increases are noted among a broad range of business materials including 
finished steel and steel scrap, copper, wood, paper and paperboard, building materials includingbrickandglass,andwoolandothertextileproducts. Energycostshavealso 
moved up a bit in the past month or so. In construction and some manufacturing industries, higher materials costs are thought to be exerting upward pressure on finished goods prices. The Philadelphia District survey of manufacturers taken in July indicates that nearly 25 percent of firms were implementing price increases, up from 15 percent in their 
iii June survey. In the Boston District, about half ofthe manufacturing contacts have raised 
or plan to raise prices, by up to 5 percent. However, virtually all Districts report that competitive pressures are holding prices down at the retail level and, presumably, retail margins are being squeezed. 
Employment and Wages 
Several Districts indicate a general tightening in labor markets and an increase in help-wanted advertising is cited. However, few Districts see any broad-based wage pressures as a result. Actual labor shortages are mostly limited to occupations such as machinists, technicians, clerical workers, construction workers, and truck drivers, although shortages of some entry-level positions are also noted. 
Jobs expansion in the industrial sector is uneven by District and industry. The use of temporary workers and high levels of overtime are continuing, and some Districts report a continuing resistance by firms to permanently expand their payrolls. Manufacturing jobs are reported to be holding steady in the Boston and Richmond Districts. In Philadelphia, where manufacturing employment is also steady, an increasing proportion of firms report plans to add to their payrolls during the next six months. In other Districts, such as St. Louis, recalls and new hires are on the rise, and in Atlanta, jobs growth is seen in the chemicals, steel, and auto industries. Reports of jobs cutbacks are more rare, although several Districts report continued layoffs of aerospace workers, and the New York District notes some jobs losses as a result of restructuring the financial and retail industries. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
The agricultural regions of the country are generally reporting favorable growing conditions, and some crop prices are falling in anticipation of high yields. Earlier concerns about a potential drought in the Richmond and Chicago Districts seem to have lessened with late spring rains. And, although rainfall has been excessive in some areas, such as in parts of the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, crop yields there are still expected to be normal, or better. Agricultural exports are also strong, helped in part by the falling dollar. 
The energy producing Districts note only a small increase in drilling and exploration activity as a result of the rise in oil prices. The Dallas District indicates that drilling activity has been focused on natural gas, although oil drilling is expected to improvethroughtheendoftheyear. Otherminingoperationsarereportedtoberunning strong; iron-ore production for the year is exceeding industry expectations. 
Lending Activity Commercial bank lending remains active with high levels of consumer borrowing 
noted in virtually all Districts. Commercial and industrial borrowing is noted as having strengthened in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. The only major lending category that may have diminished is residential mortgages. Higher mortgage interest rates ar widely cited, although interest rates are marginally higher on most types of credit. Credit standards are apparently changed very little and a further decline in credit delinquency rates is reported.",1,1
1994-07-31,"Districts report continued economic expansion, although in some areas growth has moderated recently. Contacts in a number of districts report slower-than-expected growth in May retail sales but some signs of increasing sales in early June. Manufacturing continued to show strength in most districts, with many contacts reporting increases in new 
orders and shipments. Defense-related industries, however, continue to be the weak spots. Home sales in most areas continued at a strong pace, and residential construction remains generally brisk, but some slowdowns in response to rising mortgage rates were noted. Industrial materials prices continue to rise; however, competitive pressures are mitigating price increases for finished goods. Some districts report tightening labor markets, but wage pressures appear moderate at this point. Loan demand is generally increasing, although rising interest rates have precipitated declines in some areas. Crop conditions are generally favorable in most agricultural areas; nevertheless, some districts are expressing rising concern over warm, dry weather. 
Consumer Spending 
Most districts report moderate gains in retail sales, although contacts in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, New York and Philadelphia districts report slower-than-expected sales. In particular, they cite declines in apparel sales and attribute this to unseasonably cool 
weather. Sales activity in the Boston district varied from slight declines to increases of almost 20 percent over last year, with strong demand for outdoor-related items since Memorial Day. The Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts report moderate-to- strong sales in general merchandise, particularly in apparel. The Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and San Francisco districts report strong sales in household goods and furniture, and strength in consumer durables and other big-ticket items. The Atlanta,

Reserve officials. 
ii 
Cleveland and New York districts found that discounting was needed to move merchandise; the Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City districts note that strong competition is keeping prices in line. The Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Francisco districts report strong auto sales; the Chicago, Cleveland and Dallas districts report some recent slowing in auto sales. A number of districts report that a shortage of popular models is constraining sales. 
Business Activity 
Most districts report continued growth, particularly at manufacturing firms, although the San Francisco district has mixed reports from its contacts. The Chicago and St. Louis districts report strong growth, while the Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, New York and Richmond districts report accelerating activity. The Atlanta district reports a rebound of industrial production in May after a modest slowing in April. Machinery and heavy equipment orders and production are up in the Boston, Chicago, Dallas, 
Philadelphia and St. Louis districts. The San Francisco district says the aerospace industry, especially commercial jets, has stabilized, but this industry is weak in the Boston district. Business contacts in the St. Louis district report sales increases of between 10 percent and 20 percent in some instances. The Atlanta district reports that the demand for building materials in the Southeast is up recently, and that auto suppliers are receiving a steady stream of new orders. The New York district says that its manufacturing contacts are more optimistic than a year ago. A survey of contacts in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts revealed increases in new orders and shipments. The Dallas and Richmond districts also report a steady-to-moderate increase in demand in the service sector, particularly at law firms, hotels and cargo carriers. 
Contacts in parts of the Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts are having difficulty finding qualified employees. The St. Louis and San Francisco districts both report a shortage of skilled construction workers. Contacts in the New York district anticipate few employment cuts and see wage increases of between 2 percent and 4 
iii percent. Contacts in the Richmond district plan no employment changes, but do expect 
to increase the average length of the workweek. Foreign demand for products from most districts remains somewhat sluggish. The 
Dallas and St. Louis districts, however, report some strengthening demand from Latin America and the Pacific Rim countries, respectively. In addition, the Dallas district reports strong chemical sales to Europe. The Kansas City district reports that exports are stable overall. 
Both the Atlanta and St. Louis districts report defense-related layoffs; the San Francisco district reports its defense-related industries remain weak. The Boston district says its durables producers are concerned that rising interest rates will reduce demand for their products, and Philadelphia district contacts are less optimistic now than they were at 
the beginning of the year. 
Construction and Real Estate 
Most districts report generally strong or improving home sales, although many also cite increased mortgage rates as a source of emerging or potential weakness. Residential construction remains brisk in many districts, with the majority of the construction occurring in single-family houses. The Minneapolis district stressed multifamily housing as its construction strength. The Philadelphia district, though, reports some recent slippage in residential construction. The Atlanta and St. Louis districts observed rising house prices, while the Dallas and Richmond districts report stable or slightly falling house prices. Contacts in the Atlanta district say mid-priced homes have replaced starter homes as the big sellers, but low and mid-priced homes are still the big sellers in the Philadelphia district. The shortage of construction workers in the St. Louis district is adding to the already large backlogs previously built up because of weather delays and strong demand. 
The Minneapolis district reports that the commercial construction market is strong, and the Richmond district reports recent improvements in this market. The Philadelphia 
district, however, reports a soft commercial market with slightly increasing vacancy rates. 
The Boston district reports declining vacancy rates in Boston, although Hartford's have increased. The New York district reports falling vacancy rates in Manhattan, and the Richmond district says that vacancy rates are falling throughout the district except in northern Maryland and West Virginia. 
Prices and Wages 
Most districts report that competitive pressures continue to temper price increases on the output side. Contacts in many districts report cost pressures on the input side-albeit modest in many instances. Increases in manufacturers' raw materials prices were noted in more than half of the districts. The Boston, Dallas and Philadelphia districts report increases in chemicals prices and certain metals prices, while the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Richmond districts report increases in construction materials prices. Tightening labor markets were noted in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Richmond districts. Nevertheless, upward pressure on wages, while noted by some districts, appears to be modest. In addition, Philadelphia reports continued increases in employment costs, mainly in benefits. Banking and Finance 
Despite weakness in some areas, loan demand has generally picked up in most districts. Dallas reports that loan demand is up strongly, and San Francisco indicates similar sentiment about loan demand in Idaho and Utah. Business loans have reportedly increased in the Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis districts, while demand for consumer loans has risen in the Kansas City, Richmond and St. Louis districts. The New York district reports that total loan demand has subsided because of increases in short-term interest rates; loan demand is reported to be flat in the Atlanta and Philadelphia districts. Loan demand also remains weak in California, although the San Francisco district reports that an uptick in business lending has occurred in southern California and Hawaii. Demand for auto loans has weakened in the Atlanta and Cleveland districts. The Dallas, Philadelphia and San Francisco districts noted increased competition 
among lenders, leading some banks to offer more attractive terms to borrowers. Most other districts report little or no change in lending standards, although some report higher lending rates. For instance, the New York district reports that all of its surveyed banks have increased their rates charged on commercial and industrial loans. Despite recent increases in long-term rates, mortgage lending is mixed. New mortgage lending remains relatively strong in the Dallas, Kansas City and St. Louis districts, but has ebbed in the Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts. Most districts report a pronounced decline in mortgage refinancing activity. After a strong first quarter, the Boston district reports that mutual fund sales in the second quarter have slowed considerably. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources Crop conditions were generally favorable in most areas, with crop development and 
planting ahead of schedule. Richmond reports that some recently planted crops may have suffered from unseasonably warm, dry weather. Likewise, St. Louis reports increasingly drier conditions, and some insect problems were noted in the wheat and corn crops. Dallas reports that the winter wheat crop is expected to be off 25 percent from last year because of adverse weather. Minneapolis and Kansas City report adequate soil moisture with most crops in good-to-excellent condition. Kansas City reports that the recent drop in cattle prices produced feedlot losses in excess of $100 per head. As a result, the Kansas City district expects lower farm income in the livestock sector, although prospects are substantially more favorable for crop producers. 
Recent increases in crude oil prices have spurred slightly higher drilling activity in the Kansas City district, but little noticeable increase in the Dallas district. Minneapolis, on the other hand, reports a decrease in petroleum drilling activity in North Dakota and Montana. The Minneapolis and San Francisco districts reports that lumber 
prices have increased, while Minneapolis indicates that recent increases in copper and steel prices have benefited district producers.",0,1
1994-05-31,"Solid economic growth is reported in most parts of the country. conditions remain weak, although some positive signs are starting to emerge. Reports from all Districts indicate that retail sales were strong in March, due in part to improved weather in many parts of the country. Retail pricing remains competitive, as few price increases and some price cuts are noted. Apparel sales improved, and auto sales are very strong. Service sector activity is reported to be good, with strength in business services and tourism. Manufacturing activity is expanding overall, although aerospace activity continues weak. Production of autos, vehicle parts, steel, and building materials is near capacity. Price increases are reported for some raw materials, but competitive pressures appear to be restraining prices for most manufactured products. Agricultural conditions are good in most parts of the country. Oil drilling activity is down, but drilling for natural gas remains strong. Home sales activity is reported brisk in most parts of the country, and improving in the Northeast and California. Several Districts note that recent interest rate hikes have contributed to a temporary surge in home sales. Contacts indicate that lending activity is picking up, with greater strength in consumer lending than in business lending. Retail Trade

contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
In California, 
ii awaited spring weather in much of the country, combined with an early Easter, boosted 
March results. Philadelphia reports that healthy sales continued into early April. Improved apparel sales are noted in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Pricing remains very competitive in most areas, with few price increases and some price cuts for retail products. Dallas reports slow sales growth, with the strongest gains reported by retailers who have reduced their prices during the past year. No inventory surpluses or shortages are noted. 
Reports suggest that auto sales were very strong through early April. Inventories of some models are quite tight. Most Districts indicate that higher interest rates did not reduce 
auto sales through mid-April, although one Chicago District auto dealer saw a sharp decline in activity as interest rates rose and customers worried about their losses in the financial 
markets. Services 
The service sector is generally healthy. Dallas reports growing demand in a wide range of business services, and San Francisco notes growing demand for telephone services in California and Washington. Contacts indicate that employers' health costs are rising more slowly, and health care providers are cutting their costs. Boston reports that hospitals are sharply reducing orders for large equipment. 
Hotel activity is strong in many tourist destinations throughout the West and Southeast, including Myrtle Beach, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, while 
activity is improving in many California markets and in Hawaii. In Florida, observers hope that very weak visitor activity from Europe will be offset by more tourism from the 
iii improving economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. In the northern Midwest, cold 
weather restrained winter resort activity, but industry officials are optimistic about the summer season, especially in Montana. 
Manufacturing Manufacturing activity is expanding in most Districts, although the pace of activity is 
uneven across industries and regions. Many manufacturers in the Cleveland District report that demand from foreign buyers has improved. In the Richmond District, shipments, new orders, and backlogs grew, but employment changed little. In the Atlanta District, demand 
for apparel fabric appears to have improved. Electronic equipment manufacturers in the Chicago and San Francisco Districts report healthy sales growth, but at rates somewhat 
slower than last year. The Chicago and Cleveland Districts note that vehicle manufacturing activity is at or near capacity. Several Districts report strong demand for building materials. Aerospace and defense-related manufacturing continues weak. San Francisco reports strong 
investment in computer and communications equipment, as companies replace outdated equipment in order to increase productivity and improve their competitive positions. Manufacturers note that competitive pressures are restraining prices for most 
products. However, significant price increases are reported for certain raw materials, including building materials. Chicago indicates that capacity constraints have led to price increases for special-order steel products, since extra production time must be set aside to fill these orders. Several manufacturers in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts have successfully resisted suppliers' price increases, but some have been forced to absorb the increased cost of materials. 
Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries Favorable spring weather through the third week of April created good conditions for 
field preparation and planting in much of the country. In the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts, field preparation and planting were on schedule or ahead of schedule. In the Kansas City District, however, farmers were waiting for warmer and drier weather before planting corn and soybeans. Kansas City District cattle feedlots are operating near capacity, and cattle prices are up. The Dallas and San Francisco Districts report good agricultural activity, but dry weather and water supply restrictions are creating concerns. St. Louis notes that fertilizer prices have increased substantially during the past year. 
Low oil prices have led to reduced oil production and oil drilling activity in the Kansas City District. Natural gas prices declined slightly, but Dallas reports that drilling activity is very strong in the Gulf of Mexico, where more than 70 percent of drilling is for natural gas. Real Estate and Construction 
Home sales activity is reported brisk in most parts of the country, and improving in the Northeast and California, where activity had been weak. New homes are selling well in the New York and Atlanta Districts. A contact in the Chicago District reports that home- buying traffic fell off during April after a strong first quarter. Real estate agents in the St. Louis District report a shortage of houses on the market, especially in the mid-price range, and note that many sellers are receiving two or more bids at the asking price or higher. Minneapolis reports ""tight"" housing markets in its District, with strong growth in new housing permits. In the Kansas City District, building and sales activity both are strong, and 
v inventories of unsold homes are low. Several Districts report higher building materials costs. 
Through mid-April, higher interest rates appear to have generated a surge in activity, due in part to buyers' concerns that rates could rise further. Several respondents in various regions of the country expressed concern that higher interest rates could restrain activity later in the year. 
Major commercial construction projects are under way for the first time in several years in Manhattan. Office leasing activity in New York is reported to be ""fairly brisk."" Vacancy rates and leasing activity have improved in the Atlanta District as well. Strong commercial building activity also is noted in North Dakota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Montana. Financial Institutions 
Several Districts report improved lending activity, with consumer lending generally characterized as stronger than business lending. In the Philadelphia District, consumer installment and credit card lending is reported up, while business lending is flat or increasing marginally. Mortgage lending for home purchases is up in many Districts, but refinancing activity has fallen sharply throughout the country.",1,1
1994-04-30,"Federal Reserve district reports indicate that the economy expanded moderately in January and February despite unusually severe weather in the East and the Midwest. The weather adversely affected consumer spending and construction, delayed shipments, interrupted some production, and boosted selected tourism and energy markets, but these effects were largely temporary. Manufacturing activity increased in most regions and sectors, with the auto industry and its suppliers and building products showing the most strength. Weather-related retail sales losses were sizable in some areas, but elsewhere consumer spending rose steadily; almost all district reports suggest that merchants expect 
solid sales growth in coming months. Real estate markets are mostly improving compared with a year ago, with exceptions noted in southern 
California and Connecticut. Several districts indicate that rising interest rates have slowed mortgage refinancings. In agricultural regions, financial distress stemming from last summer's floods is generally abating. Overall, only limited price pressures are reported; prices of building materials, selected metals, and some chemicals are said to be rising, but prices of manufactured products and consumer goods generally are not experiencing upward pressure. 
Retail Although unseasonably cold and snowy weather hampered retail sales 
in two-thirds of the country, districts report that merchants are optimistic, expecting sales to increase during the first half of 1994.

summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii The effect of winter weather on retail sales varied considerably. 
Eastern retailers were disappointed, citing substantial declines in sales (up to 20 percent) and minimal rebounds after storms. Midwest reports of sales performance were mixed, but retailers affected by storms expected to recoup sales losses, unlike their eastern counterparts. Several districts (particularly Chicago, Minneapolis, and Cleveland) indicated moderate to strong sales. In the West, retail conditions are generally good; California's consumer spending showed modest signs of improvement, except in the Los Angeles region. 
Durable goods are selling well in all districts. Over half reported solid growth in car sales and expectations of continued strength throughout the spring. In contrast, several eastern districts noted sluggish sales of nondurables, particularly apparel. Retailers in only one district, Richmond, expect retail prices to rise slightly; others anticipate stable prices because of competitive pressures. Services 
Scattered comments on services industries, including temporary employment firms, freight forwarders, and utilities, generally suggest improvements in economic activity. A few services industries in the Chicago district reportedly face shortages of items such as cable supplies and broadcast equipment. 
In several districts, the cold weather affected tourism, in some cases for better, in others for worse. Richmond reports that both ski 
resorts and beaches in the district are enjoying an unusually good season. By contrast, in the Minneapolis district, tourism is just starting to pick up, now that the weather has moderated. Hawaiian tourism has been sluggish, but advance bookings suggest improvement. 
iii Despite the earthquake, tourism in southern California is also gaining 
strength. Manufacturing 
The manufacturing sector generally remains on a positive course, although severe weather substantially weakened early 1994 growth in the Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis districts. Winter storms also produced minor setbacks in production, shipments, and/or orders for manufacturers located in the Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas districts. 
Durable goods and construction account for most of the advance throughout the nation. Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago indicate very strong auto-related sales demand, although Chicago notes temporary slowdowns as a result of weather and truck-part shortages. Some areas also are experiencing growing sales of home furnishings, electronics products, or other durables. Even though cold weather is delaying some construction, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas note strong demand for building materials and equipment. 
Cleveland and San Francisco report that defense and aerospace markets are damping economic progress; Boston, New York, and Atlanta 
also mention cutbacks. Clothing and shoe business has been slow in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis districts, while energy-related 
manufacturing is weak in the Atlanta and Dallas districts. Food processing is reported to be sluggish by Philadelphia and Dallas, but St. Louis and Minneapolis cite increased demand for poultry. 
Most districts indicate that prices for finished goods have remained relatively stable, despite increases for selected materials. Strong demand and scattered capacity constraints are contributing to rising prices for building products, according to Atlanta, Chicago, 
iv Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Prices also are increasing for 
some types of paper, chemicals, and metals. Almost all districts report hiring and capital expansion plans on 
the part of some contacts, especially those supplying automotive and construction markets. However, streamlining and caution continue to 
temper general gains in manufacturing employment. Real Estate and Construction 
Real estate markets continue to improve, despite severe winter weather in many districts. Construction activity has borne the brunt of 
weather problems, with five districts reporting delays, although builders in the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts reported little effect on their activity. Philadelphia and Chicago indicated that weather temporarily slowed residential sales activity. The Los Angeles earthquake will increase demand for residential repair services over the next 6 to 12 months and freeway repair will push into 1995. 
Residential sales activity is strong or growing in over half the districts and three-quarters observed positive developments in construction. Sales are reportedly flat only in the Kansas City district and California. Price increases for existing homes were noted in two districts. Low interest rates were cited as contributors to current and expected increases in residential sales in several districts. However, contacts from Cleveland and Chicago expressed concern that recent sales bursts induced by low interest rates might be short-lived. 
On the commercial side, news is less positive, although construction is starting to increase. Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco reported new construction of industrial and distribution facilities, while New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated 
v 
building activity in the apartment market. Demand for office space is flat or slowly increasing in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
Atlanta, and Dallas districts. Richmond and Atlanta report modest rent increases. Office construction has begun in those districts, and in 
Minneapolis and parts of the San Francisco district. Financial Services 
Financial institutions report that higher interest rates slowed mortgage refinancings, but in a few districts this slowdown was partly 
offset by stronger demand for home-purchase mortgages. Overall loan demand is characterized as stronger by the Kansas City, Atlanta, and Dallas districts and described as weaker by New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis. Among loan categories, business loans exhibited the greatest strength, with New York, Richmond, Cleveland, and Kansas City all registering increases. Increases in auto financing were cited by Cleveland and Philadelphia. San Francisco reports stronger business loan activity in Washington and very strong overall loan demand in Oregon, especially for real estate loans. 
Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries Dry weather in the Kansas City and Dallas districts has stunted 
the winter wheat crop and reduced the pasturage available for grazing. With cold weather also increasing the need for supplemental feeding, 
several districts--Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco-- note rising hay and feed grain prices. Accordingly, producers are reducing their livestock inventories, and cattle prices are expected to soften, with adverse consequences for farm incomes in cattle-raising regions. Calving and lambing survival rates are close to normal despite the severe weather, according to contacts in the Richmond and Minneapolis districts. The financial stress caused by last summer's 
vi 
floods generally appears to be easing, although Chicago district bankers suggest that land values and credit conditions still vary with the flood 
damage suffered. The frigid weather caused a flurry of activity in the energy 
industry. Dallas and Kansas City report that natural gas prices rose, and drilling for natural gas increased in the Dallas region. Oil exploration fell, by contrast, in the Kansas City and Dallas districts, with glutted oil markets keeping a lid on the price of crude. While drilling in the Minneapolis district remained unchanged, refinery output was significantly above year-earlier levels. Minneapolis district contacts expect 1994 to be the best year thus far in the 1990s for iron ore production.",1,1
1994-02-28,"Economic activity continued to expand with signs of acceleration in some sectors, according to most Federal Reserve District reports. Consumer spending, especially on household-related items, was strong during the holidays in most districts. Manufacturing activity strengthened, and the manufacturing employment picture improved somewhat. Residential real estate sales and construction grew robustly in almost all districts. Commercial real estate leasing and construction improved in some districts but remained generally sluggish. Loan demand increased somewhat in many districts. Several districts reported weather-related stress to agricultural crops, but crop prices rose and crop income prospects improved. Little upward pressure on wages and prices was indicated by almost all districts; however, reports of lumber price increases were widespread, and scattered labor 
shortages were reported. Weak economic conditions continued in southern California. 
CONSUMER SPENDING 
Retailers in most districts enjoyed strong sales that met or exceeded expectations during the holiday season, although the Boston District's retailers were disappointed with 
their modest gains. In the Atlanta, Dallas, and New York Districts, stores offered earlier- than-normal holiday price discounts and in the Chicago, St. Louis, and New York Districts, retailers indicated they advertised more than normal. Retailers in the Boston, Kansas City,

ii Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts expected continued economic growth to 
boost retail sales moderately this spring. Most districts reported robust sales of electronics and other home-related durables 
during December. Retailers in the Dallas, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts indicated that automobile sales were strong, and those in the Kansas City and St. Louis Districts expressed optimism about prospects for sales of new cars and trucks in 1994. In contrast, the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, and San Francisco Districts reported that apparel sales were weak; Kansas City, however, reported generally strong apparel sales. MANUFACTURING 
Most districts reported that manufacturing activity strengthened. Reports from Cleveland and Minneapolis indicated that some factories were operating near capacity, and several districts reported signs of stronger demand for manufactured products. The Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, and Minneapolis Districts noted increased demand for construction-related products, while stronger demand for automotive products was cited in the Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland reports. Personal computer orders strengthened in the Boston and San Francisco Districts, while capital equipment orders rose in the Cleveland District. The Atlanta District reported continued strength in textile orders arising from residential home sales and refurbishing. Defense-related manufacturing, however, continued to be sluggish in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, and apparel manufacturing apparently was lackluster in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts. Looking forward, manufacturers in several 
iii districts expected continued economic expansion in early 1994 and looked for continued 
improvement in business conditions. Most reports of manufacturing employment indicated improvement. Producers in 
several districts increased employment a little and those in some districts planned to add workers if economic growth continues. Manufacturers in the Boston and Richmond Districts 
expected stable employment levels in 1994. Defense-related cutbacks in employment, however, were reported in the Atlanta, Cleveland, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts, and apparel manufacturers in the Atlanta District reported further cutbacks in employment 
and a shortening of the factory workweek. In the New York District, several major manufacturers announced layoffs. 
REAL ESTATE 
Reports from most districts indicated substantial improvement in residential real estate sales and construction. Home sales increased in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts. Homebuilding also increased in these districts and in the New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, where residential construction activity exhibited unusually strong growth. San Francisco contrasted continued weakness in residential sales and construction in southern California with robust housing activity in Idaho. 
Commercial real estate activity was mixed. Office vacancy rates fell in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts. New York reported some reduction in Manhattan vacancy rates, but that market was still considered weak. Commercial construction increased in the Richmond, Dallas, and Minneapolis Districts. Commercial real estate in California remained weak according to the San Francisco report.

reported tight markets for building materials and/or construction labor. In several districts, short supplies of these inputs delayed some construction projects; in some districts, the tightness in supplies of inputs led to higher construction costs, which placed upward pressure on housing prices. 
FINANCE 
Commercial banks in most districts reported that loan demand strengthened somewhat. Bankers in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts reported moderately higher commercial loan demand. Sluggish commercial lending was reported by banks in the New York District, however, and some lenders in the San Francisco District noted that commercial loan demand had weakened slightly. Consumer loan demand was reported to be moderately higher in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts but was unchanged in Richmond. Atlanta and Cleveland noted especially high levels of automobile lending, and Kansas City and Dallas indicated increases in residential real estate lending. Atlanta and Cleveland noted 
slight declines in mortgage refinancings, although activity remained high in both districts. Bankers in the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts reported sharp declines in 
refinancing activity. 
WAGES AND PRICES 
Most districts noted little general upward pressure on prices or wages, although several reported increases in the prices of lumber and building materials and scattered labor shortages. The Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San 
v 
Francisco Districts reported that virtually all retail and manufacturing prices were little changed, and Chicago reported that the prices paid by manufacturers declined. Energy prices declined in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Prices of aircraft- quality aluminum were soft in the San Francisco District, but steel prices rose in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, and copper prices were somewhat higher in the Minneapolis District. Increases in the cost of lumber were indicated by the New York, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas reports. The Richmond, Dallas, and Atlanta reports also indicated higher building materials prices. In the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, housing prices were moving up somewhat, and the New York report indicated that higher materials prices could soon lead to upward pressure on housing prices. 
Some districts reported tight labor markets for specific workers. Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicated a shortage of skilled construction workers, and Chicago observed that finding skilled production workers and tradespeople was increasingly difficult. Dallas reported a short supply of temporary workers and a rise in their wages, but indicated that competition was keeping wages stable in other business services. AGRICULTURE 
Several districts indicated that worse-than-normal December weather and the lingering effects of abnormal summer and fall weather disrupted agricultural activity, but farm income 
levels remained steady. Snow and cold weather delayed winter small grain planting in the western part of the Richmond District, and cold weather delayed tillage in parts of Minnesota and North Dakota. Dry weather in the Dallas District damaged pastures, winter wheat, and the hay crop. Richmond and Dallas contacts expressed concern over the adequacy of hay 
vi stocks. San Francisco reported that potato production was down in Idaho but up strongly in 
Washington and Oregon. The Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted higher crop prices. Several districts indicated that higher grain prices would support crop receipts, but Chicago and Kansas City also noted that higher grain prices would also push up feed costs and reduce profit margins for livestock producers. Chicago and St. Louis indicated declines in livestock production.",1,0
1993-11-30,"Business activity has been increasing at a slow to moderate pace recently according to reports received in most Federal 
Reserve districts. More mixed reports on economic conditions were received in the New York and San Francisco districts, however. Consumer spending rose in a majority of districts, with particular strength noted in sales of autos and other durables. Tourism also displayed signs of strength in some districts. Manufacturing showed some improvement, with reports of inventory shortages in the auto sector. Residential real estate markets were generally stronger, and some pickup in commercial real estate markets was noted as well. Several districts continued to report weather-related crop damage, but conditions among livestock producers were generally favorable. Mining showed little overall change, but oil and gas exploration increased. Overall loan demand was steady to slightly improved in most reporting districts. On the price side, retail prices were described as flat or ""competitive"", while price increases were noted for some building materials and manufacturing inputs.

ii 
Consumer Spending Retail sales registered gains in Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas 
City, Philadelphia and San Francisco, but were mixed or unchanged in other districts. Philadelphia noted that discount merchants 
made greater gains than others, and Boston retailers commented on the increase in competition resulting from the arrival of large discounters. Sales of appliances and furniture were strong in a number of districts, reflecting increases in home sales and remodeling. Response to the new fall apparel was mixed, however, with some areas reporting strong demand and others, sluggishness because of unseasonably warm weather. Auto sales were good in most of the districts. Some dealers reported that inventory shortages developed prior to the arrival of the 1994 models. The five districts reporting on the outlook for the holiday season stated that over-the-year retail sales growth is not expected to be as rapid as last year's strong Christmas season. 
For the tourist industry, results were generally favorable. In the Richmond district, hotels, motels and resorts indicated an improvement due to good weather and an increase in convention bookings, while Minneapolis reported that casino visitors and campers boosted spending in northern Michigan to a three-year high. Activity was mixed in the Atlanta district, however, stronger on the Gulf in response to new casinos, but down in southern Florida. 
iii 
Manufacturing Manufacturing activity showed gains in most districts. In 
the Boston area, some contacts achieved double-digit year-to-year sales increases by introducing new products or expanding their customer base, and Philadelphia reported gains in new orders and shipments as well as increased hiring. Cleveland noted that domestic orders for capital goods appeared to be holding up well, with orders for some producers running more than 10 percent above a year ago. Manufacturing activity rose in Richmond and Chicago after a relatively flat period in preceding months, and Dallas reported a slow increase in demand and hiring. However, manufacturing activity was more mixed in St. Louis, New York and San Francisco. 
The overall improvement in the manufacturing sector reflected increased demand in several industries, but some industries continued to have problems. A pickup in auto sales spurred output at auto producers and suppliers in several parts of the country, and construction-related products such as lumber, cement, brick and glass were also cited as in widespread demand. Electronics and paper producers added to payrolls in Dallas, and some gains in the semiconductor industry were noted in the Boston and Chicago districts. St. Louis stated that small businesses in particular showed strong growth recently, but that some larger firms were reorganizing and laying off. Aerospace and defense- related cutbacks continued in Arizona, California, Utah and Washington, and apparel plants in Mississippi and Georgia also 
iv were still paring back employment in response to sluggish retail 
sales and foreign competition. Construction and Real Estate 
Most districts reported gains in the residential real estate market, with several citing sales of new and existing homes as a major source of strength in their economies. Among those districts where this sector was particularly strong (with home sales well above last year in most cases) were Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis and St. Louis. Atlanta noted that demand for new starter and mid-priced homes remained strong and that luxury home sales have improved as well, while Boston said sales were strongest in the areas previously hurt the most by the downturn. Falling inventories and rising home prices were noted in Kansas City and St. Louis. Dallas reported strong housing construction in its major cities with the exception of Houston, while Richmond said that starts in the district trended up. The residential real estate market was mixed in the San Francisco district, however, with strength in several states but softness in much of California. Starts showed little change in the New York district. 
Commercial real estate activity picked up and vacancy rates declined in New York and Richmond, while Atlanta saw signs of a revival in commercial construction. The market continued weak in downtown Minneapolis-St. Paul, but was strong in surrounding suburban areas. 
Prices Minneapolis reported virtually no sign of inflationary 
pressures, and Atlanta found that wages and prices generally were stable. Boston and Cleveland noted that pricing remained 
""competitive"" and in Kansas City, while manufacturers' input prices were rising somewhat, retail prices were generally holding 
steady. Lumber prices have been edging up in the Atlanta district, and Dallas reported that some other construction- 
related industries have also raised their selling prices. Financial Institutions 
Overall loan demand at banks was reported as steady to slightly improved in most of the districts providing this information. Consumer borrowing has shown some signs of revival, while overall business borrowing remained slow. Mortgage financing and refinancing continued strong, and auto loans picked up in some areas. Kansas City and Philadelphia reported steady to somewhat stronger demand for other types of consumer loans as well. While business borrowing has remained soft in general, Philadelphia noted some improvement in demand from small and middle-sized business borrowers, and Cleveland also reported that commercial loan demand was up a bit. Bankers in Dallas noted that lending was slow, however. Loan volume in California was flat, although other states in the San Francisco district reported somewhat stronger demand. 
vi Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries 
Large parts of the agriculture sector continued to suffer from weather-related problems, but not all the news from this sector was downbeat. Richmond reported-that yields on most crops were far below average, despite some recent improvement in temperature and rainfall, and in the St. Louis district, Delta cotton farmers said yields were significantly reduced due to heat and insects. Severe drought conditions persisted in parts of the Atlanta area where crop yields were down substantially. It was estimated that corn, soybean and wheat production will be down 20-50 percent from normal in most of the Minnesota district, and grain quality was reportedly generally poor. Kansas City noted that corn and soybean crops were destroyed by flooding in low- lying areas and Chicago stated that flood-related losses appear greater than earlier estimates, especially for corn. 
On the positive side, cotton and peanut yields in Oklahoma and New Mexico were generally above normal, and the next winter wheat crop in the Kansas City district is reportedly off to a good start. The soybean harvest was progressing well in the Chicago area and Montana's wheat crop was 9 percent above the previous record. Due to the end of a prolonged drought, acreage was up on California farmlands, while Dallas reported that crop production was good in some parts (but suffering from too much moisture in others). Livestock production was reported to be stable or improved in several districts. 
vii Minneapolis stated that metal mining output was generally 
stable, with no change in copper output in recent months. Gold production there continued above year-earlier levels and mine expansions were reportedly under consideration. Drilling rig 
counts were higher in both the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts, while Dallas noted that offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico remained near capacity levels. Volume was down in the Pacific forestry industry, however, due to restrictions on public harvesting.",1,0
1993-10-31,"Slow to moderate growth characterized economic conditions in most Federal Reserve districts in late July and in August. Geographically, economic growth appears weaker on the East and West coasts while central areas such as Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis report stronger than average growth. Employment continues to grow slowly in spite of large companies' continued efforts to restructure and cut labor costs. Manufacturing reportedly is improving in several districts. Home construction is strong in many districts compared to a year ago, and a few see some improvement in commercial real estate markets. In agriculture, several districts describe weather-related damage to crops but note generally favorable conditions for livestock producers. Mining shows little overall change, but there is some increase in oil and gas exploration. Small increases in loans are noted in some districts, and some business lending rates reportedly have fallen. General retail sales show a mixed pattern, with strength in several districts but weakness in the remainder. Auto sales are strong in most districts. Tourism is a bright spot for some districts. With the exception of lumber, prices are generally stable and there is little evidence of inflationary cost pressures. 
Labor markets 
Continued corporate restructuring is taking the bloom off employment growth. Cleveland indicates that several manufacturers emphasize near-term revival in 
employment growth is unlikely, since curbing labor costs appears to be the favored option for improving profits in view of uncertainty over sales. Several large firms in the Minneapolis and New York districts recently have announced sizable layoffs. Boston and Philadelphia look for no change in manufacturing employment, and 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and based on information collected before August 31, 1993. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Richmond foresees a decline. In the St. Louis district flooding is still keeping some people from working. 
But some districts also state that labor markets may be reviving. Several manufacturers, according to Dallas, have boosted employment, and in the Cleveland district retailers report cautious hiring. Some Minneapolis district firms have recently added workers. Moreover, even though employment has continued to decline in the New York district, the recent pace of decline has been modest. 
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing production and sales are increasing in many districts. Several districts report strong sales for firms making building materials or construction-related items. Boston notes double-digit sales increases for automotive and electronics products compared to year-earlier levels. Cleveland reports a surge in appliance production and indicates that sheet steel and heavy truck manufacturers are operating at capacity. Chicago also notes very strong heavy truck sales along with strong light vehicle assembly. St. Louis lists improved business for petroleum equipment and apparel. Dallas also notes improvements in oil field equipment, in addition to strong orders for semiconductors and telecommunication devices. San Francisco describes improvements in semiconductors and electronics. Respondents to a Richmond survey of manufacturers are optimistic about prospects for the next six months. 
The situation for some products varies by location. Dallas, Minneapolis and San Francisco have positive comments about food processors, but Boston reports food manufacturing output as flat. Similarly, Atlanta, St. Louis and San Francisco see strength in the furniture industry, which is described as flat for Boston. Textile sales are reportedly declining for Atlanta and Boston, but higher in California. 
In the Atlanta, Boston and San Francisco districts the aerospace and defense industries are still weak, as are chemicals and petroleum for Dallas. 
Construction and real estate 
Home construction is improving in many regions. For Dallas and Minneapolis, residential construction is strong. Home building reportedly is picking up momentum for St. Louis, and sales and permits rose for Richmond, particularly in the Carolinas. 
While housing starts for Kansas City were slightly below year-ago levels, they are rising and expected to continue to increase. San Francisco describes regionally mixed conditions, with strong construction in Arizona, Idaho, Oregon and Utah, but relative weakness in California, Hawaii and Washington. New York notes no change in home- building activity, and Philadelphia describes the pace of construction and sales as about even with last year. In non-residential construction, Minneapolis reports strong commercial and public building across its district. 
Boston and New York see some improvement in commercial real estate markets. New York describes the sale of a new, large office building as eliciting greater than expected interest and selling for a higher price than expected. According to Richmond, commercial real estate markets have improved in Virginia and the Carolinas but are slow elsewhere. For Philadelphia, commercial real estate is stagnant. 
Agriculture, mining and energy 
It is either too wet or too dry for normal crop development, according to reports from several districts. Continued drought has damaged corn, sorghum, tobacco and other crops as well as pastures in the Dallas and Richmond districts and in southern portions of the St. Louis district. On the other hand, flooding and excess moisture are the principal problems for Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis. These districts report substantial damage to corn, soybean and spring wheat crops. Slow crop development caused by unseasonably cool, wet weather has left many crops in the Midwest vulnerable to damage from early frosts. 
But some positive crop developments are also noted. Scattered rains brought relief for some crops in Richmond's area, while Dallas reports good cotton crops in west and northwest Texas and estimates that overall crop output will be up from last year, in spite of dry conditions. Winter wheat production is good for Kansas City and excellent for the Minneapolis district. Cotton and peanuts in Oklahoma are reportedly in good condition. And San Francisco reports generally favorable agricultural output. The livestock sector is generally better than crops, with favorable range conditions in most areas and strong prices. Kansas City notes that cattle feeders reduced inventories somewhat in response to higher feed costs. 
According to San Francisco, new mines are opening in Nevada in response to higher gold prices. An existing gold operation in South Dakota is contemplating expansion. Mining is stable for Minneapolis, though a strike at four iron mines in August cast a cloud over increased production in that sector. Dallas reports rising oil and gas drilling rig counts compared to earlier in the year and describes activity in the Gulf of Mexico as very strong. Kansas City also notes that drilling rig numbers continue to rise and are substantially above 1992 levels. St. Louis reports that lumber producers are rebuilding inventories. 
Financial institutions and credit 
Most districts report slight increases in loan volumes. Consumer borrowing and mortgage financing are up modestly in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond and parts of the San Francisco district. Mortgage refinancing is especially strong in Atlanta, Philadelphia and Richmond. 
Commercial and industrial loans, however, are generally flat across the country, though there are signs of improvement. Philadelphia reports that business loans may increase as previously postponed projects are reviewed. Loan volumes in California continue to decrease, though at a slower pace than in recent months. Chicago and Dallas observe that increased competition among banks in their districts is bringing down rates for prospective borrowers, and New York notes that about half of surveyed loan officers report moderately lower rates. 
Consumer spending and tourism 
General retail sales are strong in several districts, but weak in the remainder. For Cleveland, durable goods are moving well. Several retailers in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts report moderate increases in sales over last year. In California and New York sales are flat and mixed respectively. However, sales are unseasonably slow for Atlanta and Boston, and Minneapolis indicates that strength earlier in the year has ebbed somewhat. Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas and Richmond report that retail inventories have returned to satisfactory levels. 
Auto sales are strong in most districts. Cleveland notes that dealers of domestic new cars and light trucks enjoyed the best summer sales in more than five years. St. 
Louis car dealers report that sales of new and used domestic cars are up, in many cases by 10 percent In the Philadelphia district, auto sales are running above year-earlier levels, while Minneapolis characterizes them as stable. While domestic auto sales have climbed, import sales, especially of Japanese cars, have dropped according to Cleveland and St. Louis. 
Tourism is cited as a bright spot for several districts. Chicago, Minneapolis and Richmond report strong summer seasons. According to San Francisco, Idaho and Utah are enjoying record years, but Hawaii's visitor industry has slumped. 
Prices 
Atlanta, Boston, Dallas and Kansas City report little or no change in prices. Food prices, according to Minneapolis, are stable, and gasoline prices continue below year- earlier levels. Boston and Kansas City say retail prices are holding steady, and Dallas states strong competition has been restraining retail price increases. While Kansas City area manufacturers indicate input prices are modestly higher than a year ago, Atlanta's factory contacts report stable prices for both raw materials and finished goods. Prices are even flat for manufacturers in strong markets, Boston observes. 
Lumber is an exception to this pattern of stable prices. In the Atlanta district, home builders note lumber prices are beginning to rise again in anticipation of increased demand from rebuilding in Midwestern flood areas. Lumber prices, San Francisco says, are up about 30 percent from a year ago.",1,1
1993-08-31,"Most Federal Reserve Districts reported that economic activity continued to expand 
slowly to moderately in June and the first half of July. Flooding inflicted considerable damage in parts of the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts, but the effects of flooding were said to be highly concentrated and were not seen to threaten overall economic expansion in any District. Single-family home construction continued as a source of strength for many areas of the country. Retail sales grew across most Districts although the rate of increase varied widely. Auto sales rose in many areas of the country. Price pressures in the markets for materials and finished products were reported to be mixed. 
Manufacturing Manufacturing output growth was described as generally sluggish in most Districts 
although conditions varied. Most Districts said that manufacturers have not increased employment and do not plan to for the remainder of the year. Several Districts noted weak sales to Europe, but strong exports to developing countries. The Cleveland District reported strong demand for steel and heavy truck components, but softening orders in several other industries. Respondents in the Chicago District cited a modest slowdown in industrial expansion, although auto and heavy truck production remained high. The Atlanta and Dallas Districts noted modest growth in overall output, but found strong growth among sectors tied

contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
to residential construction. Rates of expansion for manufacturing output in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts were unchanged. Growth in Boston and Minneapolis was generally 
considered sluggish. The San Francisco District reported weakness in aerospace and defense-related industries, and strength in textiles and apparel and in computer-related industries located outside of Silicon Valley. Agriculture 
Agricultural conditions were said to be generally favorable, although flooding and drought have destroyed crops in several Districts. Overall, agricultural conditions were seen as favorable in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Kansas City and St. Louis reported that, in areas not affected by wet weather and flooding, crops were mostly in good condition and farmers were benefitting from higher grain prices. Kansas City also noted that a large wheat crop was expected and many farmers anticipated strong earnings. In the Minneapolis District, above-normal precipitation has been a boon to cattle raisers, and pasture and range conditions in the Dakotas and Montana were said to be the best in many years. 
Several Districts reported too much rain, too little rain, or both. Crop prospects are uncertain in many of these areas and will be determined by conditions between now and the 
frost. Atlanta, St. Louis and Richmond reported that hot dry weather has damaged crops in their Districts. High temperatures and drought have weakened rangeland and pastures in the 
Dallas District. Heavy rains and flooding ruined crops in portions of the Chicago, St.Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts. The Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts noted that 
corn and soybean crops were particularly hard hit by heavy rains and flooding. Minneapolis reported that unseasonably cool weather slowed crop development across the District. Chicago also reported that crops have been slow to develop. 
The Richmond and San Francisco Districts said seafood production has declined. 
Retail Trade and Services Retail sales were reported to have increased somewhat in most Districts, although 
Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia reported that sales weakened slightly in July. Overall sales strengthened in the last month in Kansas City and Minneapolis, but both the 
Minneapolis and Chicago Districts noted slow sales in flooded areas. Apparel demand was reported to be higher in the Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia Districts and weak or sluggish in the Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City Districts. Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City all reported increased auto sales. Philadelphia reported that, while growth of auto sales slowed somewhat in July, sales were expected to be above last summer's rate. Retail and auto sales were said to be mixed in the San Francisco District. 
In Atlanta, Richmond, San Francisco, and portions of the Minneapolis District, tourism was strong and the New York District reported minor gains in tourism. 
Real Estate and Construction Residential construction and real estate activity remained strong in most Districts. 
Minneapolis reported that residential and commercial construction was perhaps the strongest component in the region's economy. Housing activity continued to increase in the Chicago District, but growth was thought to have slowed somewhat. San Francisco reported strong housing markets for most of the District, although southern California and western Washington were exceptions. 
Commercial real estate activity remained sluggish or weak in most areas of the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Districts. Natural Resources 
The Dallas, Kansas City and Atlanta Districts reported that higher natural gas prices have led to increased drilling, and a rise in activity for related service companies. Although 
iv drilling is generally expected to continue its upturn, Dallas respondents said that lower oil 
prices have clouded the drilling outlook for the second half of the year. In the San Francisco District, recent Alaskan oil discoveries were said to have improved the prospects for economic activity. 
Mineral mining activity was mixed. The San Francisco District noted weaker mining activity in Utah, Idaho and Alaska, while iron output increased slightly in Minneapolis. Timber and logging activity was also cited as weakening in the San Francisco District. Banking 
Many Districts reported that business loan demand was unchanged, and that demand for mortgage refinancing was strong. According to respondents in the New York District, 
commercial and industrial loan demand continued to rise. Bankers in the Philadelphia District indicated that lending was generally unchanged although borrowing increased slightly among middle market companies. The Atlanta and St. Louis Districts noted recent strength in auto loans. The Cleveland District reported that business loans had softened and that consumer loans had leveled off, after a surge last spring. In the Kansas City District, consumer loans have increased, while business loans were flat to slightly up. Dallas said that overall loan demand had declined. Respondents in the San Francisco District said that banking conditions in California continued to improve. 
Prices District reports suggested that price pressures were mixed. The San Francisco and 
Richmond Districts saw some increased prices for building materials and other raw materials. New York and Minneapolis Districts reported that lumber prices have declined. Manufacturing input prices were stable to slightly higher in Kansas City. Chicago mentioned higher prices for auto parts. Boston reported that auto parts suppliers are under much pressure to freeze or 
v reduce prices, and that they will try to offset higher material prices with productivity gains. 
Retail prices were reported to be very competitive in New York. Chicago, Cleveland, and Dallas mentioned that several retailers have lowered their prices. Kansas City District retailers said they were holding prices steady. The Richmond District reported that retail prices were rising. Atlanta and Minneapolis noted stable price levels. 
Higher prices were reported for natural gas, but lower prices for oil. Several Districts reported higher agricultural prices, particularly in areas affected by flooding.",0,1
1993-07-31,"Business activity was increasing at a slow to moderate pace in most Federal Reserve Districts in May and early June. Manufacturing was steady or improving in most Districts, with only scattered reports of upward pressure on prices in this sector. Retail sales were generally higher. Energy industries reported slight gains. Residential real estate sales and construction were on upward trends, mainly in the South and West (except California). There were also some reports of declines, albeit slight, in office vacancy rates in some markets. Reports on bank lending were about evenly divided among increases, decreases, and no change. Crop planting was hampered earlier by wet weather, but has been completed recently or is nearing completion. 
Expectations generally are for continued slow growth. Manufacturers anticipate moderate expansion. Energy markets are forecast to improve slightly. Retailers expect improved sales for the balance of the year, and home builders anticipate a good summer. The agricultural outlook depends on a summer sufficiently warm to boost crop growth, which has been lagging due to poor weather. 
Businesses commented that investment and hiring were being delayed because of uncertainties about federal tax increases and national health care reform. Retailers also said that such concerns might be preventing a more vigorous increase in consumer spending. Possible changes in U.S. international trade policy were also prompting caution among importers. 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and based on information collected before June 15, 1993. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
MANUFACTURING Manufacturers in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and Minneapolis generally reported 
improving business, while activity was generally steady in Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond. In the San Francisco District, manufacturing in California was reported to be slipping further. Sales gains were reported by makers of electrical and electronic equipment, building materials, transportation equipment, and textiles. Demand for construction equipment was good in Chicago and Dallas, but weakening in Atlanta. Demand for aircraft engines and parts was also softening. 
Manufacturing employment was reported up in the Minneapolis District but down in Boston and Philadelphia. In addition, the outlook for employment was negative in Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond. 
Manufacturers in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis look for continued improvement, but are not forecasting significant increases in capital spending plans. In fact, Boston and New York reported that some manufacturers were trimming planned outlays. 
Manufacturing contacts in Atlanta, Boston, Kansas City, and New York reported little or no upward movement in sales or input prices. Information from industrial firms in Chicago's region indicated that price pressures have moderated in recent months. Some Districts, however, reported that firms have been able to sustain increases in their prices recently. Firms in the Richmond region reported increases in finished goods prices. In the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, higher prices were noted for some industrial materials, including steel, several chemicals, glass, and truck parts, although Dallas noted that prices of some other products were declining. 
iii 
MINING AND AGRICULTURE Dallas and Kansas City reported slightly higher oil-drilling activity, compared with the 
beginning of the year, and also reported expectations of an increase from current low levels for gas drilling. Minneapolis reported that coal shipments on the Great Lakes were off to a good start for the year. 
Most of the Districts filing agricultural reports indicated that planting had been delayed by wet weather. Where seeding had been done, plant growth was said to be behind the normal schedule in the Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts. The outlook for grains, fruits, and vegetables now depends on whether the summer is sufficiently warm to boost 
plant growth. Soil moisture levels were generally termed adequate. Kansas City and St. Louis said the winter wheat harvest was getting under way and there were indications that it would be a good harvest. St. Louis said concern was growing that cotton crops are at risk from serious boll weevil infestation. 
Livestock conditions were reported to be good by Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond, and San Francisco. Feedlots were at capacity, according to contacts in the Kansas City District, and some softening of fed cattle prices was expected. RETAIL TRADE AND TOURISM 
Nearly all Districts reported increased retail sales for May and early June. The exceptions were Boston and New York, where retailers had mixed results, and California, where sales were flat. Atlanta and Chicago said appliances, home furnishings, and consumer durables were selling well. Auto sales were up year-over-year in Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis, and the San Francisco District outside California. Domestic car sales were up in St. Louis, but foreign car sales were down. Philadelphia District dealers said truck sales were strong, but car sales, while still showing year-over-year gains, had eased recently. 
Retailers expect moderate gains for the balance of the year in Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis, but some Atlanta merchants believe the upward momentum may be waning. 
Tourist officials and contacts in the lodging and transportation industries reported modest year-over-year improvement in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Richmond Districts. They expect further gains during the summer. FINANCE 
Reports on bank lending were mixed. Overall loan volumes were increasing at slow to moderate rates in St. Louis, Dallas, Cleveland, Kansas City, and some parts of the San Francisco District. Loan volumes were described as flat by bankers in the New York and Philadelphia Districts and down in California and Richmond. Cleveland and Kansas City reported recent gains in commercial and industrial loans. Atlanta said business loans were flat, while Richmond and St. Louis reported declines. Consumer borrowing was up in Atlanta, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis. Residential mortgage refinancing was generally said to be waning, except in Cleveland, where it was rebounding. Atlanta, Richmond, and St. Louis indicated that purchase mortgage activity was up. REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Sales and construction of single-family homes were reported to be on an upswing in southern and western parts of the nation, except for California. Kansas City and St. Louis noted that improvements in housing activity in some areas were still delayed by wet weather. Nonresidential real estate activity was mixed, although Minneapolis and parts of the San Francisco District outside of California have experienced some improvements. In addition, slight improvements in office vacancy rates were noted in Boston, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond.",1,1
1993-05-31,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicate generally modest improvement in economic conditions across much of the nation. Shopper traffic and retail 
sales were reported to have rebounded modestly in April, following general declines in March resulting in part from severe weather. Manufacturers in most districts report increases in shipments and orders, with near-capacity production at some automotive and steel facilities. Higher production schedules are being met through productivity gains and overtime, although some districts have reported new hires. Residential real estate activity in most districts is strong or on the rise, and pockets of improvement in commercial office markets are noted by some districts. The general increase in lending continues to be concentrated in consumer loans and mortgage refinancing, with some reports of pickup in small business borrowing. District reports show generally stable prices, except for increases in steel and energy. 
Consumer Spending. Most districts report modest increases in retail sales during April, after widespread declines in March. Many contacts are encouraged by recent signs of improvement, but the net performance for March and April clearly will be much lower 
than for the first two months of the year. Respondents in the eastern third of the nation blame the mid-March blizzard for the net softening in sales. Retailers in the Boston 
district remark that, without the storm, sales would have been above the levels a year ago. Relative weakness in March merchandise sales is also noted in parts of the country not affected by the storm. Retailers in Chicago cite renewed consumer uncertainty and contacts in San Francisco point to concern about job security as reasons for lower-than- expected sales in parts of their regions. However, retailers in most districts report a rise in

shopper traffic and sales in April, apparently led by big-ticket items, such as furniture and home appliances. 
A general pickup in the sale of autos and light trucks in the first half of April is also reported in most districts. Dealers in the Cleveland, Dallas, and Philadelphia districts note that domestically produced models are selling at a faster pace than foreign-produced ones. Also, most dealers remain optimistic that the improved trend will continue in the near term, and they are satisfied that inventories are at manageable levels. 
Retailers generally report stable prices on most items, citing stiff competition, consumer sensitivity to price hikes, and slower sales growth. Merchants contacted by Dallas and Kansas City indicate that prices are stable or slightly lower compared to a year ago, and that they expect prices to remain stable over the near term. Richmond contacts, on the other hand, cite an upward trend in retail prices. 
Several districts, including Richmond and San Francisco, note a decline in tourism compared to a year ago. Resorts and hotels surveyed by Richmond indicate that the number of visitors is down from last year and that tourists are spending less. Hotel and convention industry representatives contacted by San Francisco characterize the Southern California visitor industry as depressed. At the same time, Atlanta reports a strong spring tourism season, with air passenger traffic, convention attendance, and the number of spring-break visitors to Florida higher than a year ago. 
Manufacturing. Most districts, except Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco, report general increases in shipments and orders, which have pushed some facilities to operate at near capacity. Cleveland notes tight conditions in some segments of the steel industry, where capacity-level production and full order books have sustained general price increases. Higher production levels in the steel industry are reportedly linked to increased activity in the motor vehicle and consumer appliance industries. One motor vehicle producer in the Chicago district indicates that production of light trucks has been bumping up against capacity limits. Increased demand has also created bottlenecks at a few 
iii 
domestic motor vehicle parts and assembly plants surveyed by Cleveland. Boston and Chicago cite strong increases in automotive parts production, and Cleveland reports near- capacity production of heavy-duty trucks. Electronics manufacturers surveyed in the Boston and Chicago districts indicate strong demand, with some respondents citing the highest level of orders in the past five years. Contacts in Boston attribute part of the higher production levels to expanding Latin American and Far Eastern markets, which have partially offset weak demand in European markets. Factory officials in Atlanta and Minneapolis note some growth, primarily in the consumer durables, food processing, and industrial machinery industries. 
With the exception of steel price increases noted by Cleveland and Kansas City, most districts report constant or only slightly higher input prices compared to a year ago. Manufacturers surveyed by Atlanta comment that competition continues to hold prices of intermediate materials and final goods stable. Dallas respondents indicate flat to slightly falling prices in chemicals, plastics, petrochemicals, and electrical and electronic machinery, and San Francisco contacts add that aluminum prices are also soft. However, purchasing managers surveyed by Chicago note a somewhat faster rate of price increases as demand improves in that region. 
Atlanta and San Francisco report that cutbacks in the aerospace and defense industries continue to dampen manufacturing activity. San Francisco respondents indicate that Boeing continues to lay off workers, although they anticipate that increased orders from foreign carriers may partially offset the weak demand from domestic airlines. Dallas notes that low levels of nonresidential construction and oil and gas drilling have contributed to lower production among the firms they contacted. Firms contacted by Kansas City report operating below capacity, in part because of decreased foreign sales. Employment. Job conditions are mixed in most regions. Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and St. Louis report that some firms are hiring modestly, particularly in automotive products and capital goods industries. However, no district 
anticipates a flurry of new hiring in the near term, even though several industries are reportedly producing near capacity. Employers surveyed in the Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, and Kansas City districts report that they are avoiding new hires by extending hours, using temporary workers, or increasing productivity. Atlanta adds that wage pressures are generally absent among their contacts. Job losses continue for defense-related and computer companies in the Minneapolis district, for apparel makers and food processors in the St. Louis district, and for a few insurance and pension firms in the Boston district. Real Estate/Construction. Most district reports indicate strong or improving residential real estate markets. Contacts in Boston and New York note recent improvement in low- priced and mid-priced home sales. A respondent in Boston expresses encouragement that condominium sales volume is up significantly, which he believes may mark an end to the slump in this market. Prolonged wet weather has reportedly dampened homebuilding in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts, but builders in both areas expect starts to pick up as the weather improves. San Francisco notes that homebuilding is strong only in areas outside of Southern California. Homebuilders surveyed by most districts indicate that the sharp increase in lumber prices in recent months has added to the cost of new homes. However, lumber industry representatives contacted by the San Francisco bank report a 20 percent decline in lumber and plywood prices from the March peak. 
The commercial real estate market remains weak in most districts, except for isolated pockets of increased activity. Contacts in Minneapolis report that commercial contract awards are up significantly from a year ago. Realtors in New York note brisk leasing of commercial office space in midtown Manhattan but subdued activity in downtown Manhattan and in a few immediate suburbs. Richmond's survey finds strong commercial activity in the Carolinas and in Richmond, but weak conditions in Maryland and in the District of Columbia. Financial Institutions. District reports of lending activity range from little change to moderate growth. Surveys of bankers generally reveal that most of the increase is 
concentrated in consumer loans and residential mortgage refinancing. Several lenders in Cleveland report that the volume of mortgage refinancing is virtually at capacity, and 
respondents in Atlanta note that mortgage refinancing accounts for nearly two-thirds of the brisk pace in current originations. Philadelphia, on the other hand, indicates flat consumer and mortgage lending, as households reportedly continue to consolidate and reduce debt. 
A few districts, including Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis, note a pickup in commercial loans, particularly to small businesses. Some bankers surveyed by Cleveland cite a strong demand by businesses to refinance existing loans. Many respondents across the country report that deposit growth is steady, attributable in part to aggressive pricing and marketing programs. Bankers from several districts describe loan markets as very competitive and state that more aggressive pricing has decreased net interest margins. A few bankers contacted by St. Louis have expressed concern that narrow margins have contributed to slow deposit growth in their region. Agriculture/Resources. An unseasonably cool and wet spring has delayed fieldwork and planting for a wide variety of crops in the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond, and St. Louis districts. This damage is reportedly not irreparable, provided the weather improves in the coming months. Winter wheat crops are said to be in good shape in the Kansas City and St. Louis districts. Richmond and St. Louis report recent improvements in the condition of their peach and apple crops. Livestock prices are high, benefiting producers in the Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts. San Francisco indicates strong prices for several other agricultural products. 
Minneapolis reports increased shipments of iron ore and stable conditions in copper mining despite low copper prices. Dallas and Kansas City report seasonally low domestic oil drilling. OPEC production cutbacks and blizzard-related consumption hikes are expected to keep oil and natural gas storage levels low and prices on the high side for several months.",1,1
1993-04-30,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicated that economic growth continued in early 1993. Trends in economic activity seemed increasingly uniform by region, and although New England and California remained relatively weak, signs of growth were apparent in several sectors in each of these regions. Nationally, retail sales growth generally held up well in early 1993 after a strong holiday season, although inclement weather may have constrained sales in several districts during February. Reports from manufacturers generally indicated continued moderate expansion in activity, with production gains led by consumer durable goods and household items. Commercial and industrial loan demand remained flat or increased only modestly, however, with most districts reporting that loan growth was concentrated in consumer and home mortgage lending. Reports on employment gains were mixed, but still suggestive of some overall improvement in labor markets. Scattered price increases for basic materials were noted, and lumber price increases were widespread, but district reports continued to show little evidence of generalized upward pressure on prices. 
Consumer Spending. Retail sales growth held up well in most districts in January and early February, with contacts in several regions reporting better-than-expected sales following a strong holiday 
season, although some contacts noted that adverse weather held back sales during February. Relative strength was reported in sales of durable goods, household items, or big-ticket items by retailers contacted in Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Some department store contacts reported double-digit sales increases in St. Louis. In the Northeast, Boston noted some strengthening in sales after mixed results for the holiday season, and retailers in the New York district reported better-than-expected sales gains during January. Relative weakness was noted in parts of the Dallas and San Francisco districts, although one large retailer stated that conditions in California had improved somewhat. Atlanta reported some slowing in the pace of growth after a strong fourth quarter, and some retail contacts in Boston stated that sales gains slowed in late February. Bad weather reportedly impacted sales in February for retailers contacted by Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City. At the same time, Richmond and Minneapolis both reported strong winter tourism seasons, and tourism was also a bright

Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii 
spot for contacts in Atlanta and Dallas. Several districts noted relatively low levels of discounting for this time of year, citing lean inventories in winter goods, and a good start for sales of spring merchandise was 
reported by retailers in the Philadelphia and Cleveland districts. Surveys conducted by several district banks found that retailers' expectations were generally optimistic, and planned inventory accumulation was underway in several cases, although ordering and inventory stances generally remained somewhat cautious. 
Manufacturing. Reports generally indicated continued moderate expansion in industrial activity, with signs of slowing in some markets balanced by accelerating momentum in others. Production growth was led by output of consumer durable goods, principally goods related to housing activity as well as motor vehicles and parts. Above-average gains in production of appliances, furniture and residential construction materials were reported by contacts in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis. Robust sales gains in construction-related manufacturing industries were noted in Dallas. Production gains among auto parts manufacturers were cited by Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago. Several large domestic automakers contacted by Cleveland expected to meet March production schedules calling for output to rise 20 percent from a year ago. Contacts in several districts expressed concern about sales in Europe, but St. Louis stated that strong exports continued to bolster production for a number of manufacturers in the region, and each of the ports contacted in the Richmond district expected exports to pick up over the next six months. Relatively weak results were noted for firms producing energy exploration and production equipment, firms in the paper industry in the Minneapolis district, and aerospace and defense companies reporting in Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco. At the same time, however, San Francisco noted that conditions were generally improving for other manufacturers in the region, with relative strength noted for manufacturers of computer equipment and software, capital goods, and biotechnology products. A broad majority of manufacturers surveyed in New York and Philadelphia expected stable or increasing activity, and Philadelphia also noted a pickup in the demand for industrial space. Broadening strength in output was indicated by the expectations of a group of capital goods producers surveyed in Cleveland, although Cleveland also noted a modest slowdown in growth in the relatively robust heavy-duty truck market. Sales gains reportedly rose among a wide majority of manufacturing contacts in the St. Louis district, with orders exceeding expectations for many firms. 
iii 
Banking. District reports indicated sluggish to modest growth in bank lending activity, with growth concentrated primarily in consumer and home mortgage lending. Surveys of bankers generally indicated flat to modestly stronger commercial and industrial loan demand. Banks surveyed by Kansas City and San Francisco reported that commercial and industrial loan demand was largely unchanged, while reports in Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago indicated somewhat stronger increases in demand. However, Atlanta noted some disappointment among bankers in the pace of improvement. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas districts reported some of the strongest gains in manufacturing activity in the nation, but reports from bankers surveyed by each of these districts indicated that commercial and industrial loan demand was only flat to slightly increasing. Cleveland noted that potential borrowers were relying on strong internal cash flow or alternative sources of financing. Still, where surveyed, bankers' expectations for future growth in business lending were generally favorable. New York reported a sharp increase in the willingness of small and medium-sized banks to make some forms of business loans, although San Francisco observed that financing for small businesses remained tight. Consumer and mortgage lending was stronger than business lending across most regions, and most districts also noted renewed strengthening in home mortgage refinancing activity as well as new residential mortgage lending. 
Real Estate/Construction. District bank reports on new and existing home sales and residential construction were almost universally positive. Underlying trends in housing activity remained relatively 
robust during a seasonally slow period for many areas, although inclement weather adversely impacted results in several regions. Declines in mortgage interest rates, increased buyer confidence, increased new home sales activity and/or lean inventories reportedly led to improved appraisals of market conditions by homebuilders in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas. San Francisco noted that sales activity increased in California, although prices remained soft. Residential construction activity was one of the strongest aspects of the report from the Minneapolis district. Weather difficulties were reported to have constrained activity in parts of the districts covered by Atlanta, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco, although San Francisco also reported that housing starts in Arizona rose to their highest level in ten years. Most reports indicated little sign of improvement in commercial real estate markets, but reports of new deterioration were also thin, and Richmond noted an increase in activity and declining vacancy rates in both industrial and office markets. 
Agriculture. Reports on agricultural conditions were mixed but generally favorable. Increased rains and snowpack accumulation were aiding crop production in several regions, although St. Louis noted some concerns that substantial rainfall may have damaged the winter wheat crop, and flooding 
threatened the winter lettuce crop in Arizona. Crop prices were reported weak or below year-earlier levels in Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis, with Richmond noting some concern about the potential impact on 1993 cash receipts. San Francisco reported favorable conditions for livestock producers, with good spring grazing expected. Higher beef prices were reported to have improved returns for ranchers and feeders in the Minneapolis district, although Kansas City noted that harsh winter weather slowed weight gains, increased death losses, and raised production costs for cattle feeders in that region. Still, bankers in the Kansas City region reported that farm borrowers generally remained in strong financial condition, with timely payments reported on agricultural loans. 
Employment. District bank reports on employment gains were mixed, but suggestive of some strengthening overall. Stable or increasing employment was more consistently noted in trade and service 
sectors than in manufacturing. A survey of retailers in the Boston district indicated little change in employment at existing locations, but about one-quarter of these firms reported plans to open new stores 
and hire new workers. Similarly, Cleveland reported that retail employment was following the normal layoff pattern after the holiday season, but expansion by several chains was expected to prompt hiring gains. Reports in the Richmond district indicated that retail employment was expected to improve over the next six months. Increased hiring by industrial firms was reported in some regions, helping to offset other reports of continued pressure on manufacturing employment. Significant layoffs in aerospace and defense-related industries were noted by San Francisco and Atlanta. Employment reportedly showed little sign of strengthening in Minneapolis, and layoffs proceeded at paper mills in that region. Producers were largely comfortable with current employment levels in the St. Louis area, but many of these contacts reported improved prospects for hiring. Most of the manufacturing firms contacted by Philadelphia expected employment to remain flat, although roughly one-quarter of these firms expected hiring gains. Some manufacturing firms in the Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis districts have been rehiring previously laid-off workers. Temporary help firms in Chicago and Dallas reported increased demand from manufacturing finns, and Dallas also stated that many manufacturers reported permanent employment gains. Several personnel supply companies contacted in the Chicago district reported increased permanent hiring of individuals previously working on a temporary basis.",1,0
1993-02-28,"Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicate continued improvement in economic conditions across much of the nation. Conditions are 
mixed, however, in the San Francisco district where weakness in California continues to offset moderate growth in other district states. Retail sales during the holiday season were significantly better than a year earlier in most districts, generally fulfilling or exceeding retailers' expectations. Manufacturing activity is steady to increasing moderately in nearly all districts, but this improvement may not be reflected proportionately in labor markets. District reports contain little evidence of significant upward pressure on prices. While the residential sector continues to improve in most districts, commercial real estate markets generally remain weak. Overall loan demandatfinancialinstitutionsisrisingslightlyinmostdistricts. In agriculture, record yields of fall crops have pushed prices down, but gains in the livestock sector are expected to help boost overall farm income slightly. Retail 
Sales in the holiday season posted significant year-over-year gains in most districts, with mixed results in the San Francisco district and in the Northeast. Sales gains were smaller in California than in other states in the San Francisco district, and a minority of retailers in the Boston district reported flat sales. Retailers in several districts reported sales better than expected. In a number of districts, merchants noted that sales gains

were achieved without the heavy promotions and aggressive price cutting of recent years. 
A wide range of merchandise apparently sold well, with some regional variation. In the St. Louis district, sales mainstays included jewelry and 
smaller appliances and electronics items. Atlanta reports significant increases in sales of goods ranging from apparel to big-ticket durables. In the New York district furniture and rugs sold well. Merchants in the Chicago district noted that sales held up well in the post-holiday period, especially sales of big ticket durables, including major electronics, appliances, and furniture. Retailers in the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts expressed optimism for further sales growth in early 1993. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity is reported to be steady to increasing moderately in nearly all districts. Activity appears to be flat to expanding modestly in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond districts. Stronger but less than robust activity is reported by Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas. San Francisco reports that Twelfth District manufacturing activity continues to contract, due to further weakening in aerospace and defense- related industries in southern California and Washington; manufacturing shows some improvement, however, elsewhere in the district. 
Manufacturing activity in the Cleveland and Chicago districts has been boosted by increased motor vehicle production and related increases in the 
output of steel and tires. As a result, Cleveland reports rising capacity use ratios for some steel producers, while strong demand has pushed production close to capacity for some tire producers. Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas report some increases in the production of housing-related products, such as 
iii 
furniture and construction materials. Capital goods producers reported an uneven but rising trend in their business, with uncertainty about a possible 
investment tax credit leading to some postponements of orders. The moderate improvement in manufacturing activity may not be reflected 
proportionately in labor markets. Boston reports that half of its respondents expect their work forces to remain at the current level, while the remaining respondents expect to implement reductions. Most of the manufacturers contacted in the Philadelphia district were holding employment steady. In the Cleveland district, most manufacturers believe they can increase production with their existing work forces. Some firms in the St. Louis district expect to add jobs, however, and a major home appliance manufacturer has recalled a largenumberoflaid-offworkersandexpectstoaddsubstantialnewhires. In the Minneapolis district, layoffs by two computer equipment firms and an airline have been partly offset by new hiring elsewhere in the district. Construction and Real Estate 
The residential sector continues to improve in most districts. Home sales, as well as housing starts and permits, were generally better in 1992 than in 1991. Lower mortgage rates, increased consumer confidence, and pent- up demand were cited as responsible for the improvement. Boston reports slow but steady improvement in its residential real estate market. While Kansas City notes a recent slowing in housing activity, Minneapolis reports its busiest winter construction season in six years. Some glimmers of hope for multifamily construction also appear, as both Atlanta and Dallas report rising occupancy rates and firming rents. San Francisco reports mixed conditions in its residential sector. House prices have weakened further in southern 
iv 
California and softened in parts of Washington, but have risen in Oregon and Utah. 
Commercial real estate markets remain generally weak, but there are some positive signs here and there. The office vacancy rate in downtown Buffalo, while still high, fell in 1992 for the first time in four years. Activity in the Richmond district's nonresidential sector has increased in recent months, with vacancy rates falling in some areas and more inquiries from businesses in strong financial condition. Nonresidential construction has been expanding in the St. Louis area, primarily in public works and new factories. Minneapolis also reports a sharp rise in public works contracts, as well as in construction of some new shopping malls across the district. One of the new malls was built in a border town to cater to strong demand by Canadian shoppers. Nonresidential real estate markets remain weak in much of the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Vacancy rates are still high in Dallas, but prices there have fallen enough to bring a pick-up in property sales. Several markets are weak in the San Francisco district, where commercial rents and property values are depressed by high vacancy rates and continued employment losses. Financial Services 
Financial institutions report a further slight increase in overall loan demand in most districts. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. 
Louis, and Kansas City report slow growth in business loans. New York reports slow growth in business loans by small and midsized banks. Most districts 
note a drop-off in mortgage lending, reflecting reduced demand for refinancing. Dallas reports little change in loan demand, and San Francisco 
notes mixed conditions in the Twelfth District. In California, loan demand is 
weak and the volume of outstanding loans continues to fall. Some growth in loan demand is evident, however, in Arizona, Utah, and Washington. Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries 
Despite some unseasonably wet weather in parts of the Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts, fall crop yields have been near record 
levels. Large supplies of corn and soybeans have pushed prices down, thus restricting income gains for crop producers. But lower crop prices also mean 
lower feed prices and likely income gains for livestock producers. Overall, farm income is expected to be up slightly in 1993 and farm operators are seen 
as likely to maintain their solid financial condition. Metal mining continues to be weak in the Minneapolis district, where 
slack orders have led to two iron mine shutdowns and substantial layoffs. Dallas reports a slowing in energy industry activity, although Kansas City cites a recent rise in the number of operating drilling rigs in its district. Both districts agree that drilling is likely to drop sharply in the near term, however, because certain tax incentives for drilling expired at the end of 1992. Dallas also notes that low margins have led many refiners to reduce their capacity. 
Conditions in the lumber and wood products industry vary somewhat across the nation. St. Louis notes that orders at southern pine lumber mills are 
down slightly, although production remains well above last year's level. San Francisco reports that orders for wood products are firm and inventories are 
low, while Minneapolis reports strong demand for lumber and for plywood substitutes.",0,1
1992-11-30,"Economic activity has continued to increase in most of the districts, but at a slow and uneven pace. Boston, Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all reported some improvement, ranging from a slightly 
more positive tone in Boston to a modest expansion in St. Louis. Developments in New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco were described as mixed, with improvement in some sectors and sluggishness in others. Retail sales grew in most districts though the extent of the gain varied. Activity in the manufacturing sector apparently lost some momentum in much of the nation as several districts noted a slower pace of expansion or declining demand. An improvement in residential construction and sales was noted in several districts, with gains generally concentrated in the low-to-middle-income range of single-family housing. Several districts have reported a slight increase in overall loan demand. Cool and damp weather continued to delay harvests in much of the nation although yields on many crops were very good. The few reports received this time on wage and price developments referred to generally stable conditions, though with

scattered price increases reported on a few individual items. Consumer Spending 
District reports indicate that retail sales improved in most areas in recent weeks, though the extent of the gain varied. Moreover, some retailers stated that the selling climate remained difficult and that discounting and other promotional efforts were needed in order to achieve the latest increases. Sales gains varied from slightly improved in Boston and Philadelphia to 
markedly improved in Cleveland. Sales of nondurables were strong in New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City while Philadelphia and Cleveland registered gains in most items. Retail activity remained sluggish in California, however, as defense-related employment cutbacks continue. Districts reporting on automotive sales were evenly divided between those experiencing some softness and those with a pickup in demand. With the exception of some excess auto stocks, retail inventories remain at generally satisfactory levels in most districts at this time. Respondents in four of the districts expect at least somewhat higher holiday sales this year than last. Tourist activity has slowed in the Richmond District, primarily because of fewer convention bookings, but remains a bright spot in Atlanta and Minneapolis. 
Manufacturing Activity in the manufacturing sector apparently lost some 
momentum in much of the nation as several districts, including Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia, noted a 
iii slower pace of expansion or declines. Richmond, St. Louis, 
Dallas and the San Francisco District outside of California noted some improvement, however. Aircraft and defense goods, nonelectrical machinery, rubber and plastic products and primary metals were cited as products for which demand has slowed. Respondents pointed to the weakness in foreign economies and dampened consumer confidence in this country as sources of concern. On the other hand, manufacturers of building supplies, carpeting and other home furnishings have seen an increase in demand as a result of the post-hurricane rebuilding in the South and an uptick in housing demand in some other areas. Dallas reports strong demand for fabricated metals and electrical and electronic machinery and San Francisco notes that demand from Latin America and Pacific Basin counties is supporting 
manufacturing activity in that district. St. Louis reports that manufacturing employment gains continue to outnumber reports of 
losses. With regard to the outlook, Boston states that manufacturers are cautiously optimistic, and those in 
Philadelphia believe that the upturn which began last spring is still on track. Manufacturers in Cleveland are optimistic about 
the next six months. Construction and Real Estate 
An improvement in residential construction and sales was noted in several districts with gains generally concentrated in 
the low-to-middle-income range of single-family housing. Boston reported that the real estate market has stopped declining in 
iv most New England states and that the volume of sales is up 
substantially from a year earlier. Cleveland and St. Louis noted that residential contracts and permits were well above the year- 
earlier pace and Richmond reported strong sales to first-time 
homebuyers. Single-family homebuilding is providing the only 
source of strength in the Dallas construction industry as was also the case in Kansas City. In Florida, a good deal of hurricane-related residential rebuilding is now taking place. San Francisco reported sluggish sales and declining prices, particularly on more expensive homes, in California and a big jump in foreclosures in the southern part of the state where defense-related job cutbacks are still occurring. However, stronger residential markets exist in other district states such as Oregon, Utah and Idaho. A majority of districts noted that multi-family housing starts have been flat. Most banks report relatively slow nonresidential construction activity, a major exception being Minnesota where there has been a substantial increase in awards for infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and water/sewer construction and where the building of casinos and new motel space is underway. 
Financial Institutions 
Several districts have reported a slight increase in overall loan demand in recent weeks. Mortgage refinancing activity, 
however, seems to have peaked in a number of areas. Philadelphia noted that some banks saw a recent pickup in commercial and 
industrial loans and that consumer lending was level or 
increasing. Atlanta banks reported loan demand as flat or slightly higher with some increase in consumer loan activity. A few large banks in Cleveland saw a step-up in business loans in recent weeks though, as in several other districts, the most active part of the market continued to be residential mortgages. St. Louis and Kansas City also reported a recent increase in loans outstanding with business, real estate and consumer loans 
up in St. Louis and most categories stronger in Kansas City. Overall loan demand remained sluggish in New York where demand 
for business loans declined, and Dallas noted a softening of loan demand that some bankers attributed to business borrower caution about the near-term economic outlook. Financial conditions were mixed in the San Francisco District. There was weakness in California, where consumer loan demand continues to drop and commercial loan demand is weak, but brisk demand for mortgage loans in Utah from consumers upgrading their housing and from continued migration into the state. With regard to the outlook, bankers in Dallas expect business loan demand to rise slowly and Miami anticipates some increase in loan demand from the process of hurricane rebuilding. Philadelphia bankers say the outlook is uncertain and none predicted accelerated growth. 
Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries Cool and damp weather continued to delay harvests in much of 
the nation. In Richmond the harvesting of summer crops and the planting of small grains were slower than normal as unseasonably cool weather delayed the maturing of corn and soybeans. 
vi 
Minneapolis notes that an unusually cool and wet growing season delayed crop maturity and continues to retard harvest operations, but that yields for all major crops except soybeans are generally 
excellent. Cool weather also impaired the growth of late-planted crops in Dallas and production estimates have been reduced slightly as a result. In Kansas City, however, corn, soybean and milo yields are generally larger than normal while cotton and peanut yields are near normal. In addition, the planting of winter wheat is nearly complete in that district and the crop is generally in good condition. The soybean harvest was at a near- normal pace in the Chicago district except in Michigan where rain slowed harvesting. Progress with the corn harvest has been considerably slower than normal due to the high moisture content of this year's crop. The cotton harvest in St. Louis was hampered by adverse weather conditions, but good to excellent 
yields are reported for corn, soybeans and rice. California reports that while parts of the district are experiencing drought, sunny weather has helped tree crops such as apples and cherries whose production is well above last year's levels. 
Mining has been lackluster in Minneapolis with low prices for gold and copper and slack demand for iron ore. Aluminum 
production remains high in California despite sharply falling prices but the output of forest products continues low. The surge in domestic demand for plywood resulting from recent hurricane damage has apparently subsided and shipments to Japan and other Pacific Basin countries remain down.",1,1
1992-10-31,"Economic activity has been improving slowly in most of the nation, but the pace of recovery has been uneven across regions and sectors. Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and 
Richmond report modestly improved conditions in their Districts since our last report. Some weakening of economic conditions is reported by Chicago, and in California by San Francisco. The remaining Districts generally report a continuation of slowly expanding activity. Retail sales are reported steady or slightly higher by most Districts, but auto sales are lackluster. Manufacturing activity has weakened in autos, aerospace, and defense-related industries. In manufacturing outside of these sectors, however, improvement is noted in orders, production, and sales. Residential construction activity appears to be improving slowly in most of the nation, particularly in low to mid- priced housing, but nonresidential construction remains weak. Agricultural conditions are good in most Districts. The clean-up and reconstruction from Hurricane Andrew is expected to stimulate economic activity in southern Florida and Louisiana. Little upward pressure on prices has been evident, except for products such as lumber and natural gas associated with storm-related damage. Consumer Spending 
Retail activity is mixed across the nation, with some Districts reporting steady or slightly improving sales, and others reporting sluggish conditions. Contacts in the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts indicate that sales picked up in recent weeks. Chicago and New York also report that, after accounting for the late Labor Day holiday, underlying sales growth rose in both August and early September. Chicago reports increased demand for appliances and home

ii improvement items, while New York reports increased demand for fall clothes due to cool weather. 
Back-to-school sales in early September are reported strong by Cleveland, New York, and St. Louis. Dallas, however, reports sluggish conditions in most of its major markets, and Boston reports that two-thirds of its retail contacts experienced sales declines in the summer from year-earlier levels. Retailers in the San Francisco District also report weak demand for soft goods in most markets. In particular, retail activity in southern California is said to have declined. Outside of California, however, retail sales are reported to have improved. Inventories are at or below projections in most Districts. 
Auto sales are reported as steady to rising by Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis. Generally sluggish conditions, however, were observed by other Districts. Chicago and Cleveland report that major automakers are disappointed by these recent sales trends, and that dealers have cut orders below sales in order to prevent an unwanted buildup of new car inventories. While sales of light trucks outperformed those for cars during August, dealer orders for light trucks also began to lag sales in recent weeks. According to Chicago, one domestic automaker attributes the weak car sales to an erosion in consumer willingness to purchase, rather than to income trends. Showroom traffic has improved, but sales closures have weakened. 
Several Districts said this has been a good summer for tourism. Atlanta reports good convention activity and moderate increases in tourism boosted by discounted air fares and an influx of European visitors responding to the weak dollar. Boston-area tourism also has benefited from an increase in foreign visitors, and Minneapolis reports a good summer tourist season at national parks in its District. Tourism in Hawaii, however, was reported down due to a large drop in California visitors, and contacts report that tourist-related retail and service sector jobs are down in Los Angeles. 
Manufacturing Auto production has fallen in recent weeks, and job losses continued to be reported in 
aerospace and defense-related industries. Outside of these sectors, however, several Districts report general increases in manufacturing activity. 
Chicago and Cleveland report that due to disappointing sales and a recent labor dispute, auto production has failed to meet earlier expectations. Auto production in the fourth quarter is expected to remain near the relatively low third-quarter rate, even if the production losses due to the recent labor dispute are fully made up. Inventories remain lean, however, and production would respond quickly to any sales pickup. Cleveland reports that steel producers anticipate little change in production over the next few months, as the pace of new orders for October and November is slower than expected. 
San Francisco reports that aviation production rates are dropping, and that layoffs among defense and aerospace manufacturers were announced in southern California and Utah. St. Louis reports that consolidation in the aircraft industry has preserved jobs in its District, at the expense of other regions. Boston and Cleveland also report cutbacks in orders and production among suppliers to the aerospace industry. 
Outside of these sectors, most Districts report general improvement. According to Cleveland, manufacturing output appears to be picking up due to increased demand for high-tech products and a slowly reviving industrial equipment market. Increased production of non-military electronic equipment is noted by several Districts. Chicago, Cleveland, and San Francisco note increased production of heavy trucks to meet both domestic freight needs and export demand. Several Districts report increased demand for building products due to Hurricane Andrew, and Chicago and Dallas note that industries tied to single-family home construction are experiencing strong sales. Farm equipment demand and production, however, are reported to have fallen by Chicago, Minneapolis, 
and San Francisco. Construction and Real Estate 
Several Districts note some improvement in residential real estate and construction activity. Boston reports that real estate sales have been fairly strong over the past few months, with first-time home buyers taking advantage of low interest rates and relatively low prices. Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis report strong increases in housing starts and demand, and note increases in both building material costs and home prices. An increase in home sales and prices is noted in the St. Louis District, although construction activity is mixed. Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond also note increased sales activity. Ample existing home inventories, however, have kept prices stable in these Districts. San Francisco reports that while residential sales and construction activity is increasing in several states, residential markets in California are sluggish, with price decreases reported for higher priced properties. In general, Districts are observing that activity is strongest for homes in the low to mid-price range. 
Weakness persists in nonresidential construction activity, according to most Districts. Demand for office space remains weak in Philadelphia, in part due to ongoing consolidation by local companies. Older buildings are said to be especially vulnerable to decreasing demand. New York reports that vacancy rates remain at high levels, so plans to construct four new office towers in Times Square have been put on indefinite hold. Office demand also remains weak in the Dallas District, where a turnaround in office construction is not likely to occur for at least three years. San Francisco reports that nonresidential construction activity in California continues to weaken. In addition, contacts in Oregon report that several major nonresidential projects are on hold until next year. Minneapolis, however, notes that contract awards for public school buildings are more than offsetting declines in commercial and industrial construction. 
Financial Institutions Financial institutions report that loan demand is generally flat, with some increase in mortgage 
lending, in part due to refinancings, offset by weakness in demand for consumer and commercial credit. Bankers in the St. Louis District describe loan demand as soft. Weak demand for auto loans is noted by New York, which cites competition from automobile financing companies as a reason. Dallas reports that the largest constraint on loan demand is the lack of qualified borrowers. San Francisco reports that low interest rates are improving the profitability of District financial institutions, but demand remains soft for commercial, industrial, and consumer loans in most markets. The weakest loan demand in the San Francisco District was found in California, where delinquency rates for commercial real estate also continue to rise. Several Districts note that currently low interest rates have increased the level of mortgage refinancings. While some Districts observe that the rate of refinancings is below that seen in early 1992, contacts in Atlanta expect that the volume may eclipse the record posted earlier this year. Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries 
Cool and damp weather has affected agricultural conditions across much of the nation. Slower maturing crops are delaying the fall harvest in the Midwest. In the absence of an early, crop- 
damaging frost, however, Minneapolis and Chicago expect bumper harvests of corn and soybeans in their Districts. Kansas City also expects above average yields of these crops in Kansas and Missouri, but reports crop damage in parts of Oklahoma and Nebraska due to heavy rains and hail. Dallas notes that cotton yields are likely to decline because of the cool weather. 
Hurricane Andrew damaged the lime, avocado, mango, and foliage plant crops in Florida, and the sugarcane crop in Louisiana. Except for limes, however, fruit and vegetable prices have 
remained relatively stable as lost supplies have been replaced by imports. Drought conditions are expected to lower farm income in Idaho and eastern Oregon. The unusually sunny weather, however, 
vi 
has produced sharp increases in tree fruit crops in Oregon and Washington. Several Districts report that lumber prices, which decreased in July, have rebounded to high 
levels as result of Hurricane Andrew. Dallas reports that hurricane damage to platforms and pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico has reduced the supply of natural gas and has boosted natural gas prices. 
Prices are likely to rise above their normal seasonal increase for the next three to four months as repairs take place. Elsewhere, electricity prices are up in the Pacific Northwest due to drought- related reductions in hydroelectric power. A 20 percent increase in wholesale electricity rates has been proposed in Oregon; this would increase average retail bills by 5 to 10 percent.",1,1
1992-08-31,"Home sales and home building activity in recent weeks varied by region 
but appeared on balance unchanged for the nation as a whole. Cleveland and St. Louis reported decreased sales, and Richmond indicated that sales were 
flat. Atlanta, Chicago, and Minneapolis, however, reported increased sales, as did San Francisco for all states except California, where sales were weak. 
Residential construction activity rose in the Chicago and Dallas districts, and in the San Francisco district outside of California. Homebuilding activity decreased in the St. Louis district and was generally unchanged in the Atlanta and Kansas City districts and in California. New York and Minneapolis indicated mixed activity in their districts. 
Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas said that lower interest rates were not spurring home buying, although Chicago indicated that lower rateswerehelping. IntheNewYorkandRichmonddistricts,realestate agents mentioned that the job security concerns of potential home buyers were continuing to dampen sales. Nonresidential Construction 
Nonresidential construction activity generally remained sluggish. Atlanta noted that most activity stemmed from either private custom-built or 
government projects. New York and Richmond, however, indicated that some new commercial projects were underway. Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported continued depressed commercial real estate prices. Office building vacancy rates in the New York district, while still high, evidently fell in recent weeks as rents became more competitive.' Dallas and San Francisco indicated that commercial property was selling far below construction costs. 
Lower interest rates apparently had had little effect on commercial real estate loan activity. The demand for these loans was reported to be flat or 
down by Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco, and steady to somewhat higher by New York. Financial 
On balance, financial conditions improved slightly across the nation over the past six weeks. Loan demand was characterized as stronger by Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City and described as stable by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Commercial loan demand continued to exhibit weakness, although Richmond and 
Kansas City cited some improvement. Among districts commenting on consumer loan demand, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City registered increases, 
while New York, Richmond, and St. Louis reported no change. Among loan categories, home mortgages exhibited the greatest strength in most districts, but the bulk of the activity was attributed to refinancing, which picked up somewhat in early July. Atlanta and Chicago noted that some banks were more aggressive in seeking new loans, but Boston found that small businesses were still choosing to obtain credit from nonbank sources. 
Lenders in the Philadelphia and Dallas districts expected loan demand to be flat over the next few months. Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago cited the continuing reluctance of bank customers, particularly businesses, to take on new debt. 
Inventories Inventory conditions varied across the country. Reports of retail 
inventories were especially disparate. Philadelphia and Chicago reported 
levels below and in line with plans, respectively. Atlanta reported retail inventories to be at historically low levels. Inventories inmanufacturing 
edged up in the Philadelphia district, and were unchanged in the Richmond district. Dallas district manufacturers described their inventories as high. Both Kansas City and Dallas respondents expected inventory levels to fall in the weeks ahead. 
Prices and Costs Richmond and Kansas City indicated small increases in the prices charged 
by retailers and manufacturers in recent weeks, while other districts reported little change. Manufacturers' input prices were stable, although Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas noted increases in business and production costs. Construction costs rose in the Kansas City and Minneapolis districts. St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco reported recent declines in lumber prices, while Kansas City reported increases. Dallas indicated increases in the prices of chemicals, petroleum, and steel. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported greater-than-average increases in health care costs. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources Conditionsinagriculturewereslightlyimproved. IntheRichmond, 
Chicago, and St. Louis districts, and in areas of the Kansas City district, recent rains have brought relief to heat- and drought-stressed crops. Dallas reported that crops in the district had benefited from a return to more normal weather. Damage to wheat was reported in the San Francisco district, however, where dry conditions in the Pacific Northwest reduced yields, and in the Chicago district, where too much rain harmed the crop. Minneapolis and Kansas City reported that hail had harmed some crops and that crop development had 
been slowed by unseasonably cool weather. In the livestock sector, Chicago indicated increased hog production, and Kansas City reported that cattle herds 
were expanding slowly. Movements in farm prices varied. Crop prices were reported to be above 
last year's levels by Minneapolis but declining in the Dallas district. Livestock prices were lower in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City 
districts but stable in the Dallas district. Chicago indicated that milk prices were up. 
Energy activity in the nation evidently continued to contract in recent weeks. The drilling rig count declined substantially in the Kansas City district, where activity was near historically low levels, but rose somewhat in the Dallas district. Oil industry respondents in the Dallas district indicated that they were cutting domestic exploration spending.

1992-07-31,"Economic activity continues to improve. The manufacturing 
sector appears to be strengthening in all districts. The Chicago, Dallas and St. Louis districts report gains in nonmanufacturing sectors as well. All districts except Boston, New York and San Francisco report moderate increases in consumer spending. Residential construction activity remains well above year-ago levels in most districts, and new home prices have risen in several regions. Loan demand appears to be increasing in most districts. Price stability in the retailing and manufacturing sectors seems to be the rule across districts. Adverse weather has affected agricultural prospects in many districts. 
Manufacturing 
All districts report improving manufacturing conditions, except 
for the defense and aerospace industries. The Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Francisco districts report that orders are increasing modestly, while Atlanta and Chicago note much sharper 
gains. Most of the increases come from durables-producing industries within each district. Employment at manufacturing firms continues to rise in the Chicago, Philadelphia and Richmond districts. The Atlanta district reports that some firms have increased hours in response to increased demand. The Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts also report that at least one-fourth of the surveyed firms will hire new employees during the next six months. The Chicago district adds that an increase in orders for new cars is expected to require additional shifts and/or overtime. The St. Louis district reports employment

declines because of plant closures and relocations, while the San Francisco district reports significant declines because of defense industry cutbacks. 
Reported inventory levels are mixed. San Francisco district firms report no inventory concerns, while firms in the Kansas City district find their inventories either satisfactory or slightly high. Richmond district firms experienced no changes in inventories or backlogs and foresee no changes in the next six months. 
Demand for exports of manufactured goods seems to be waning because of weakening foreign economies. For example, the Boston, Minneapolis, Richmond and San Francisco districts report a drop-off in the volume of durables exports, especially electronics to Japan and appliances to Canada. The San Francisco district, however, reports that exports of electronic components to other Pacific-Rim nations remain strong. Nonmanufacturing 
The St. Louis district reports strengthening in the growth of 
nonmanufacturing employment. Southern California, on the other hand, has 
experienced a large loss of retail and service-related jobs in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, and the New York district will post significant retail job losses by this fall when 15 major department stores in the New York metropolitan area are closed. Outside of retailing, the Chicago and Dallas districts report increased activity in business-related services. The San Francisco district indicates growth in advertising but declines in telecommunications. 
Consumer Spending Most districts report increases in non-auto merchandise sales. 
All districts except Boston, Cleveland, New York and San Francisco report modest gains in April and May, while the Minneapolis, Philadelphia and 
St. Louis districts note year-over-year gains as well. Much of this growth is attributed to the late Easter season. The Dallas, Philadelphia and Richmond districts identify big-ticket items as slow movers, and Atlanta concurs by stating that nondurables are selling better than 
durables. The Dallas district notes greater improvement at mid- to upper-scale stores than at discounters, while San Francisco indicates increases at both department and discount stores. Contacts in the Boston 
and New York districts blame unseasonably cool weather and the news of 
potential additional layoffs for their poor sales. Auto dealership traffic and sales are increasing steadily in most districts; the Dallas 
and San Francisco districts, however, report slower or ""spotty"" growth. Construction and Real Estate 
Residential construction activity continues to be a source of 
strength in most districts. While construction has stabilized or dropped off slightly in some districts since its first-quarter surge, contacts in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond and St. Louis districts describe the pace of residential building activity as strong. Newhome prices are reportedly higher in the Dallas, Kansas City and Richmond districts because of increased lumber costs and low inventories. New and existing home sales are mixed, with the Atlanta and Minneapolis districts reporting a slight downward trend in sales and the Kansas City and Richmond districts reporting a continued increase in sales. No appreciable improvement in commercial real estate markets is reported. Banking and Finance 
Loan demand appears to have increased slightly in most districts. Contacts in the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, New York, 
Richmond and San Francisco districts report stable-to-stronger loan 
demand. The Philadelphia district describes loan demand as soft, and the 
St. Louis district reports that loan demand appears to have weakened in 
iii 
recent weeks. The source of increased demand varies by district; some 
report increases in consumer loan demand, while others note improvements 
in business loan demand. The Kansas City and San Francisco districts report increases in both categories. Prices 
Inflationary expectations in retailing and manufacturing remain relativelysubdued. Contacts in the Boston, Dallas and Philadelphia districts report retail prices as stable, while contacts in the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond and San Francisco districts report slight-to-moderate price increases. Manufacturing and retailing wage pressures remain moderate-to-low across most districts. Manufacturing materials prices remain relatively stable across districts, although steel producers in the Chicago district report higher input prices. Agriculture, Energy and Natural-Resources-Related Industries 
Many districts report that unseasonably cool weather and 
inadequate soil moisture have hampered the planting and development of many crops. In the Chicago, Kansas City and St. Louis districts, adverse weather has affected the corn, cotton, soybean and winter wheat crops. 
Declining livestock prices have recently led cattle and pork producers in 
the Kansas City district to curtail production. The San Francisco district reports that, except for grains, agricultural exports to Mexico and the Pacific Rim (excluding Japan) have been strong lately. Despite the recent firming of oil and gas prices, the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts indicate that the energy sector remainsweak. Lumber production is up significantly in the St. Louis district, but down in the San Francisco district.",0,1
1992-05-31,"According to contacts across the country, economic activity has increased further since the last survey although conditions remain uneven across regions and sectors. The 
Chicago, Atlanta, Richmond, and Cleveland districts report noticeable improvement, while the Dallas, St.Louis, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts report continued moderate rates of economic expansion. The San Francisco, New York, Boston and Philadelphia districts report continued sluggish economic activity. These districts, however, report either slightly improved conditions or increased optimism about the near-term outlook. 
Manufacturing activity has picked up in most regions of the country. Continued growth in residential construction has been widespread. Many districts report gains in retail sales. Several regions, however, report continued declines in commercial construction, energy extraction and defense manufacturing. While the demand for non-mortgage loans generally is reported as weak, there has been some pickup in demand for these loans in several regions. Producer and consumer prices are reported as generally stable. Retail 
Retail sales have increased in most regions and many districts report improved optimism about future sales. Sales of most product lines have improved. The Chicago and Richmond districts note particular strength in consumer durables such as home furnishings 
and appliances. Several other districts note gains in nondurables. Retail respondents in the

Chicago area note that much of the lost sales due to recent flooding downtown was made up by increased sales in the surrounding areas. Auto sales have increased in many areas. The most notable exception to improved retail sales is found in the Philadelphia district which reported a recent decline in sales. The San Francisco, New York and Boston districts report mixed retail performance. 
Manufacturing The most significant change since the last Beige Book survey appears to have 
occurred in the manufacturing sector. While respondents in the last survey generally described the manufacturing sector as weak, respondents have been significantly more upbeat recently. The Chicago and Cleveland districts report some improvement in motor vehicle and steel production and pronounced gains in orders for capital goods such as machinery and electrical equipment. Respondents in the Richmond district note strong increases in shipments and orders across many industries. 
Respondents in the Atlanta and Dallas districts report strong gains in manufacturing industries tied to residential construction and moderate gains in industries such as apparel, 
paper and electronics. However, the manufacturing gains in the Dallas district have been offset somewhat by continued declines in energy-related industries such as oil field equipment. The San Francisco and Boston districts note continued weakness in defense- related manufacturing. 
Construction Residential construction has continued to increase in most districts although the rate 
of growth appears to have slowed. The San Francisco district reports widespread gains in residential construction; the New York district reports increased optimism from home 
builders; and the Philadelphia district reports an overall slight increase in home construction. Several districts report increased pressure on home prices partly due to sharp increases in the cost of lumber. Respondents report that lumber prices have increased because of a sharp rise in lumber demand, harvesting restrictions and a recent trade levy on Canadian lumber. Commercial construction remains weak in most markets. 
Services Tourism and convention activity is increasing in the Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis and 
Richmond districts. Respondents in the San Francisco district report continued weakness in newspaper advertising revenue, due partly to low levels of real estate advertising. Residential real estate brokerage activity is reported to have increased in most markets across the country. The Dallas district reports that the demand for legal and litigation services remains strong and that accounting and consulting firms are seeing an increase in demand from companies seeking to increase productivity. 
Agriculture and Energy Extraction Several districts report favorable agricultural conditions although extreme weather has 
slowed planting in some areas of the country. Kansas City and St. Louis report that the winter wheat crop is in mostly good condition. Agricultural prices have generally declined. Although cattle prices remain at very high levels, Kansas City reports that cattle feeders remain wary that sluggish consumer demand for beef could trigger another drop in prices later this summer. Several districts report ample liquidity for agricultural lending. 
The energy sector continues to decline. Oil and natural gas prices remain at low levels, and the drilling rig count continues to fall. Oil and gas industry respondents in the Atlanta district report that business activity continues to decline and that further layoffs are 
likely over the next few months. St. Louis reports that year-to-date coal production has declined about 6 percent from a year earlier. Bank Lending 
Bankers in several regions report that loan demand has begun to increase, although demand remains uneven. Most banks across the country report an increase in mortgage originations and a slowdown in mortgage refinancings. Most regions continue to report soft demand for non-mortgage loans. The Richmond, Dallas and St. Louis districts report increases in non-mortgage loans. Boston reports that some small businesses continue to have difficulty obtaining bank credit, but contacts have found satisfactory alternatives, particularly trade credit from suppliers. Prices 
Producer and consumer prices are generally reported as stable. Boston reports that manufacturing prices are flat to down and that retailers are feeling pressure to lower prices. The San Francisco district reports little upward pressure on prices, with the exception of lumber and health care. Atlanta reports that while most contacts report relatively stable input prices, a growing minority of factory contacts are reporting increasing material prices. Respondents in the Kansas City district also note stable material prices, but prices are expected to rise slightly over the next few months.",0,1
1992-04-30,"Most Federal Reserve Districts report some improvement in economic conditions. Business sentiment is described as modestly more optimistic in many parts of the country, though it remains cautious. Representative of many Federal Reserve Districts, Chicago notes ""a slow but increasingly widespread advance in the economy since the end of January."" Or as St. Louis puts it, ""Most sectors ... are reporting growth."" Most-often mentioned as improving are residential construction and home sales, auto sales, and other retail sales. There are few indications of significant upward pressures on retail and wholesale prices of goods. 
Most-often mentioned as flat or weak are manufacturing and nonresidential construction; bank loan demand is described as little changed. The manufacturing sector remains generally flat, with layoffs and rising unemployment often noted. Yet several districts report glimmerings of recovery in manufacturing, with improving expectations for future activity. Commercial construction remains moribund. Bank loan demand is best described as flat, although residential mortgage lending is often mentioned as a bright spot. Mortgage refinancing activity appears to be tapering off some- what. 
Wages and Prices Continuing the trend of recent reports, wage and price pressures appear generally quite 
moderate. An exception is a survey of Buffalo (New York) purchasing managers: the percentage reporting higher input prices jumped markedly in February. In addition, several districts mention lumber prices. These are up sharply in some areas, due to increased construction activity and

restricted supply. San Francisco observes that some grades of lumber are selling at historically high price levels. As reported in the last Beige Book, oil and gas prices remain low. 
Consumer Spending Most Federal Reserve Districts report some improvement in retail sales so far in 1992 and 
guarded optimism on the part of merchandisers. An exception is San Francisco, which notes that retail sales remain soft in that district. Perhaps more representative is Boston, which reports improvement for retailers of all types. Richmond notes that consumer spending improved in late January and February after a flat December and early January. And Cleveland observes that con- 
sumer spending exceeded expectations in both January and February. Automobile sales have exhibited widespread (if often modest) improvement. Districts report- 
ing at least some increase in car sales include Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Only Dallas notes declining auto sales. Several 
districts also mention strength in light truck sales. 
Manufacturing The manufacturing sector is probably best described as ""mixed."" A number of districts 
report continuing layoffs and rising unemployment in manufacturing (for example, New York, Minneapolis, and San Francisco). But other districts describe modest gains in manufacturing ship- ments or output (Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas). St. Louis notes that several outside manufac- turers are relocating in that district. Those areas reporting some strength in manufacturing often attribute it to improved demand from the retail sector and residential construction. Several districts, including Richmond and Kansas City, report declining inventories, but Cleveland notes that inventory liquidation may have ended. 
Real Estate Sales and Construction Continuing the trend noted in the last Beige Book, all Federal Reserve Districts report at least 
modest improvement in real estate sales or residential construction or both. In a few areas, gains have been quite substantial. In Chicago, building material sales to homebuilders were quite strong, and Dallas reports that the inventory of houses has fallen to a low level. In many parts of the country, demand is apparently strongest for moderately priced homes. Richmond, San Francisco, 
and Chicago report that home prices are generally flat, but Minneapolis and Dallas note some increases. As has been true for some time, nonresidential construction is moribund in most parts of the country. San Francisco notes a decline in commercial building sales prices, and New York mentions rising vacancy rates for commercial office space. 
Banking and Finance Loan demand is generally flat, with most districts reporting little change in demand for 
consumer or commercial loans and commercial real estate lending remaining in the doldrums. Credit standards are described as largely unchanged. Although most districts note that the wave of mort- gage refinancing has continued, it appears to have slackened in response to the recent rise in mort- gage rates. New residential mortgage lending is mentioned as a bright spot by a number of districts. 
Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries Conditions in agriculture are varied, depending on the product and the weather. Richmond 
reports that weather and crop conditions were excellent in January and February. However, Kansas City cites a recent downturn in farm incomes and a slight rise in problem agricultural loans. Dallas and Minneapolis comment that declines in livestock prices have hurt some ranchers. Recently, much-needed rains fell in the Kansas City and San Francisco districts. 
iv 
Dallas, San Francisco, and St. Louis note continued low oil and gas prices. Minneapolis and Dallas report that as a result of these low prices energy exploration and development expenditures are down.",1,1
1992-02-29,"Reports by business and banking sources contacted by Federal Reserve districts suggest that activity was lackluster as the year drew to a close. Retailers in most districts report that holiday sales were at or modestly above year-ago levels before adjustment for price changes. Manufacturing sources generally note steady or declining production and employment. Except for export goods, orders and backlogs generally softened into 1992. According to realtors, lower mortgage rates have aided home sales, particularly of lower-priced properties. Single-family construction expanded modestly, while new commercial activity remained dormant. Aside from a surge in mortgage refinancing, banking sources suggest that consumer and business loan demand has not revived. Bankers report no change in credit standards. While some bank contacts report ongoing loan quality problems, others are optimistic about prospects for improvement as borrowers work down debt service burdens. Energy industry contacts confirm that lower oil and natural gas prices are leading to cuts in expenditures for drilling and energy- related products. District reports indicate that commodity and materials prices were generally unchanged or declining; pressures on wages and retail prices have been minimal. Despite 
softness as the new year began, business and banking contacts generally anticipate that economic conditions will improve by mid-year.

CONSUMER SPENDING 
Retailers generally confirmed that holiday sales were flat to slightly higher than year-ago levels before adjustment for inflation. Discounters and some specialty stores posted better performance at the expense of traditional department stores. Sources in Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Dallas report modest sales gains led by nondurable goods, particularly basic apparel and other small-ticket items. Sales in several districts were below expectations, and retailers in the Philadelphia district have continued to cut prices through early January. 
Inventories held by retailers in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and Philadelphia were above target levels in early January, while retailers in Atlanta, New York, and Kansas City were content with current inventories. Retail contacts generally do not plan to expand stocks aggressively in the first quarter. 
According to auto dealers, new car sales were generally weak in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts. However, Minneapolis and Cleveland report some improvement in auto and truck sales. 
Retailers and auto dealers generally expect sales to recover in 1992, but not until the second half of the year. Strict inventory control, competitive pricing, and continued cost-cutting 
were cited by several districts as the general strategy for the near future. 
MANUFACTURING Factory activity faltered in most districts through early 1992 according to those surveyed. 
Renewed weakness in production and orders was cited by most contacts. Dallas contacts report that chemical production is flat and demand for oil field machinery is declining with oil prices. 
iii 
Weak auto output has hurt auto suppliers, according to Cleveland and Atlanta. Chicago also cites continued weakness in auto production and few signs of a turnaround in orders for appliances, heavy equipment, or primary metals. 
St. Louis and Atlanta report stable or increasing demand for packaging materials, where some price increases are sticking. Export demand continues to rise for some firms, according to sources in Kansas City, Boston, Richmond, and St. Louis. Manufacturers in Philadelphia report steady industrial output. 
Boston contacts indicate that capital spending is restrained by adequate or excess capacity and concerns about debt. Cleveland sources confirm that capital goods orders recently declined. Plants are generally operating below capacity, according to industry contacts in Kansas City, and 
Dallas chemical producers are concerned about overcapacity. Several districts report that, despite recent reductions in interest rates, capital expenditures will remain at 1991 levels until economic conditions improve, although there were several reports of productivity-enhancing capital projects. 
Kansas City, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Richmond report generally stable prices for material inputs and products. Factory product prices are flat in the Boston district; the weakest lines are being discounted. 
Inventories in the Kansas City and Philadelphia districts continue to drift downward, though no district reports excessive inventories as a major problem. Plans to expand stocks are conspicuously absent. Manufacturers' general expectations for the first quarter are for continued 
weak sales and flat prices, but sources are relatively uniform in expecting significant improvement in sales and production in the second half of 1992. 
REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Realtors in most regions report that lower mortgage rates have prompted modest gains in home sales. In Atlanta and New York, real estate contacts note that a significant portion of the home sales originated with first-time buyers and lower-priced properties. Sales in the Boston and Richmond districts remained mostly flat over the past six weeks. Except in the San Francisco district, which reports some continued decline, sources in most areas find home prices 
to be relatively stable. Reports from St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and Atlanta note some improvement in 
single-family starts, but starts in the New York district remain slow due to generally sluggish demand. Multifamily activity remains stalled in Atlanta but is accelerating in Dallas. 
Realtors, mortgage lenders and home builders are generally optimistic for the spring. Bankers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City believe residential mortgage activity could post healthy gains. Atlanta realtors expect strengthening sales and St. Louis builders believe that 
conditions will improve significantly by mid-1992. In the Dallas district, industrial and office real estate demand is flat. Office leasing 
declined in the New York area since the last report. Commercial activity in the Minneapolis district is mixed. Dallas and St. Louis report moderate increases in public construction. BANKING AND FINANCE 
Aside from a surge in mortgage refinancing, most districts report consumer and business loan demand has not expanded significantly. Contacts in several districts say that households are refinancing from adjustable-rate to fixed-rate mortgages. San Francisco also suggested that savings from lower monthly payments are being used for household debt reduction. Gains in 
v new mortgage activity are much spottier. Demand for other consumer and business loans was 
generally reported flat or down. Reports on loan quality were mixed. New York contacts report increased delinquency 
rates on all types of loans, forcing some restructuring. San Francisco found that bank profits are still restrained by deteriorating real estate loans. Philadelphia bankers expect improving portfolio quality as lower interest rates reduce debt service costs. Bankers in Atlanta noted either stabilization or improvement in the quality of their portfolios during the fourth quarter. 
Credit standards, on balance, remain unchanged. The consensus among banking contacts is that aggregate loan demand will remain flat until the second or third quarter of 1992. AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
Winter crops are generally said to be in good condition across the nation with the exception of the Dallas district, which reported severe weather damage to agricultural production. Livestock producers in several districts are struggling with lower prices. 
Declining oil and gas prices have resulted in reduced drilling activity in the Kansas City and Dallas districts. Dallas reported that lower prices are creating a somber energy outlook for 1992 and added that some producers are shifting exploration overseas, while many energy and 
related companies have announced layoffs.",0,1
1991-11-30,"Sources contacted by the Federal Reserve banks generally described the economy in September and early October as weak or growing slowly. In most districts there has been little improvement in retail sales, and a few reported some slowing. Auto sales have generally been weak. Expected crop yields vary, but agricultural prices remain low. Manufacturing output is still improving although at a slower pace in some areas. Several districts reported some increase in home sales, but residential construction is still at low levels. Loan demand has been weak for commercial, industrial, and consumer loans. Some districts noted a pickup in real estate loans, especially refinancings.

ii August. Cleveland and Richmond reported that sales have slowed in the last month. Two districts indicated improvement in retail sales. Kansas City reported sales increased somewhat, and 
Minneapolis reported ""fairly strong"" sales. New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas indicated that retail 
inventories were under control, but some contacts in Cleveland and most in Kansas City considered inventories too high. 
In general the outlook for the holiday sales season is cautious. In Kansas City, however, some retailers are expecting relatively strong sales for the holiday season, and in Richmond they are optimistic about their business over the next six months. 
Auto sales were reported to be flat or down from last year in many districts although the Cleveland District indicated that sales rose in late September and early October, and Minneapolis noted a recent surge in truck sales. Several contacts in the Cleveland District said dealers' orders for new models are slightly above year-ago levels; but Atlanta indicated that orders have been mixed and dealers there do not expect an acceleration of demand. Dealers in the Philadelphia District are also pessimistic about prospects for the 1992 model year. 
MANUFACTURING In most districts output and shipments in the industrial 
sector have been stable to slightly higher. Philadelphia noted that the pace of advance had slowed recently. There was also some indication of slower growth in the immediate Chicago area. San 
iii Francisco mentioned that conditions were still worsening in California and in the Pacific Northwest while the industrial sector 
in Idaho and Utah remained stable. Cleveland and Chicago reported that autos and steel have been most responsible for the recent increases in manufacturing. Boston and St. Louis noted weakness in the defense industry. 
Boston and Cleveland mentioned that manufacturing inventories are at satisfactory levels while Kansas City noted that firms are still trying to trim inventories. 
Reports about new orders were mixed. Richmond noted an increase in new orders, and some manufacturers in the New York District have seen an improvement, but new orders were weak or declining in Boston and Philadelphia. Orders for defense goods in St. Louis and for oil field machinery in Dallas were reported to be down. 
Philadelphia and Richmond said that, on balance, manufacturers expect improvement over the next six months. Boston, however, noted concern about renewed softness. 
REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION Reports on housing were also mixed. New York, St. Louis, and 
Kansas City reported some increase in home sales, and Atlanta and Minneapolis reported mixed conditions with increases in some parts of their districts and declines in other parts. Richmond said that housing markets in the district are sluggish. Likewise, San Francisco reported that home sales in California and the Pacific 
iv Northwest, which had rebounded earlier in the year, were now sluggish. New home construction is still slow in those districts 
that mentioned it. In the commercial leasing market, the New York District said 
rents were still falling, and San Francisco reported plummeting commercial rental rates in the Los Angeles market. 
AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES In the agricultural sector, expected yields compared to last 
year vary by crop, but prices generally remain low. Drier than normal weather has reduced yields for corn according to several district reports. The Chicago District added that corn yields, although lower than last year, are turning out to be much better than earlier estimates. In the Dallas District and in parts of the Minneapolis District, excessive precipitation hurt crop production although yields are still good. In North Dakota, corn and dry bean yields are sharply higher than last year; in the Richmond District they are slightly lower. The wheat crop forecast for Montana is the highest in many years. Prices for many crops, livestock, and dairy products are weak. San Francisco reported that high production of fruits and vegetables in California's Central Valley has lowered prices for those products. 
Low natural gas prices have reduced drilling activity in the Kansas City and Dallas districts. Dallas also reported that some energy firms have announced layoffs. 
FINANCE In general, loan demand has been weak. Overall demand has 
decreased in the New York District, and total loan volume continued to decline in Philadelphia. In Kansas City demand for commercial and industrial loans is down, and demand remains soft in Chicago. New York and San Francisco specifically mentioned that consumer loan demand was sluggish. Atlanta, on the other hand, reported moderate improvement in loan demand in September. And in the last two months, total loans outstanding have increased in the St. Louis District. A number of districts have experienced increased demand for mortgage loans, especially refinancings spurred by lower interest rates. 
Several districts reported that the majority of banks have not raised credit standards in the past few months. Cleveland noted that some banks appear to be less aggressive in seeking loans",0,0
1991-10-31,"The economic recovery continues to be uneven across the country. Although some Districts apparently are not sharing in recovery, others, such as Chicago and Cleveland, continue to revive largely because of the upswing in manufacturing. Industrial production has provided considerable impetus to recovery, reflecting in part export demand and a reduced pace of inventory liquidation. 
As yet, there is little sign of a sizable rebound in consumer spending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery. Retail sales in recent months show only scattered improvement, and most retailers are cautious about sales prospects. Retail inventories are indicated to be close to desired levels. 
Residential investment seems to have lost some upward momentum in recent months, with fewer than half of the Districts reporting further increases in housing sales and housing starts. 
Hot, dry weather in much of the country has hampered farm output, especially corn. Bumper crops of rice in some parts of the St. Louis District and record crops of cotton are anticipated in St. Louis and Dallas. Farm commodity prices and livestock prices have declined recently (San Francisco, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas).

i 
ii Loan activity remains soft in most Districts. Chicago, Cleveland, 
Philadelphia, and St. Louis report a continued reduction in business loans, while mortgage loans in general remained flat. Manufacturing 
The strongest sector of the economy is manufacturing. Most Districts note a continuing upturn in activity in recent months, but manufacturing apparently is still languishing in a few Districts (especially Boston and San Francisco). 
Export growth has been a source of strength in manufacturing, and more recently, a reduced pace of inventory liquidation in some industries 
reportedly is adding to the recovery. Developments are not uniform through all Districts, however. Some inventory liquidation apparently continues in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Richmond, while Boston reports satisfactory inventory levels and Cleveland comments that the correction phase in inventories is nearing an end. 
Both Chicago and Cleveland note strengthening among consumer durable producers, led by rising automotive and appliance output, which has supported a gradual rise in steel production. Further increases in auto output are expected for next quarter (Cleveland). Capital goods industries are beginning to show signs of recovery. Chicago points out that electronics, heavy machinery, and food processing machinery have all shown some recent turnaround in orders, and Cleveland cites an uneven revival in heavy-duty trucks and industrial equipment. Dallas also reports that sales have increased in the electronics and electrical machinery industries because of some rebuilding of depleted inventories. 
iii Retarding a comeback in production in some Districts is the cutback in 
defense contracts, resulting in declining orders in Philadelphia and Atlanta and in San Francisco's aerospace industry. 
Manufacturers in most Districts appear to be more optimistic about near-term prospects, and those in Philadelphia and Richmond plan to increase 
their capital spending over the next six months. Consumption 
There is still little indication of a stepped-up pace in consumer spending for durable and nondurable goods. Retail sales between July and early September were relatively flat or slightly higher than their levels earlier in the summer. Sales of back-to-school merchandise were described as ""weak,"" ""slower-than-expected,"" or ""disappointing"" (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas). New car sales in August were off in some Districts (Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta), although a limited inventory of 1991 model cars is partly blamed for the reduced sales pace. Cleveland, however, expects a somewhat higher level of new car sales this quarter than last. In general, retail inventories appear to be close to desired levels. 
Retailers generally are cautious about near-term sales prospects, and only a few of the Districts report optimism about the outlook. 
Real Estate and Construction District reports suggest that recovery in housing sales and starts has 
slowed recently, although a few Districts comment that sales or starts were still rising in July and August. Both San Francisco and Chicago report that home sales softened in recent months after a spring rebound. Still, housing 
apparently has become more affordable because of recent easing in mortgage rates and because of lower home prices in some areas. 
Commercial construction appears to be at a virtual standstill in many Districts. High vacancy rates for commercial buildings and declines in rental prices have been blamed (New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco), but tight credit standards for acquisition and development loans have also apparently restricted commercial construction (New York, Chicago, Atlanta). Agriculture 
Dry weather is expected to reduce the corn yield in Kansas City, and early reports on this crop in the St. Louis District are mixed. Richmond expects that corn and soybean yields will be normal to above normal in some areas, because of recent timely rain. A bumper rice crop is expected in Arkansas, but yields in Mississippi may not be as good (St. Louis). A record harvest for cotton is expected (St. Louis and Dallas). Crop yields in Minneapolis are predicted to be ""generally good."" 
Adverse weather has also affected pasture conditions in Kansas City, but the livestock industry is nevertheless ""mostly good"" in St. Louis. Fruit growers in California report large harvests, but dry August weather reduced the harvest of apples and grapes in Washington (San Francisco). 
Several Districts report declines in farm commodity prices. Potato, hay, and beef prices are off substantially from a year ago in San Francisco, and 
the Minnesota index of farm products fell sharply again for a variety of crops and livestock. Banking 
Nearly all of the Districts state that loan activity is relatively flat, or has eased further in recent months. The New York District's comment that banks are willing to expand loans but are facing reduced demand, seems to capture a theme common to several Districts. Demand for business loans continues to be weak, and has softened further in some Districts 
(Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis). In some Districts, consumer installment loans either fell or held steady, except in Atlanta, where some 
pickup occurred. Most Districts report either little demand for new mortgage loans or slight declines from previous months, and even some easing in 
mortgage refinancing (Cleveland). Some Districts find that credit standards have not changed in recent months (New York and Chicago), but Richmond notes a tightening for commercial loans and Atlanta cites a tightening for both auto dealer and commercial development loans. In several Districts, mortgage rates have eased recently.",0,0
1991-08-31,"According to contacts across the country, national economic conditions continue to improve, but at a slow, uneven pace. Retail sales are said to be flat or edging up on average. Nevertheless, respondents from all areas expect a modest recovery in retail sales during the second half of 1991. Manufacturers report some increase in activity, on balance, but recovery is not uniform; demand for consumer goods is said to be stronger than demand for capital equipment; demand for manufacturing labor shows signs of stabilizing. By contrast, several districts report that state and local governments and some service industries are cutting employment. The pickup in home sales in the spring has lost some momentum, and commercial real estate markets and nonresidential construction remain weak. In most districts, business loan demand shows little strength. Hot, dry weather threatens crops in several regions. Retail 
Retail sales during June and early July are described as flat or edging up in one-half of the Federal Reserve districts. In the remaining districts, New York, Cleveland, and Richmond respondents report declines, while those in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas report moderate increases. 
Retailers east of the Mississippi note month-to-month variability. Unseasonably warm weather in May caused an acceleration in purchases of

summer items, thereby weakening June results. Hot weather in July boosted demand for some seasonal products, but discouraged other purchases, especially automobiles. 
In recent weeks, apparel sales were strong in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas regions. Major home 
furnishings were more often a source of weakness than of strength. Sales figures at automobile dealerships differed widely both across and within districts as a result of economic and credit conditions, weather, consumer preferences, and the timing of fleet purchases. Retail inventories are generally described as satisfactory, and many retailers remain conservative in placing new orders. 
The consensus outlook calls for a modest recovery in retail sales during the latter half of 1991. However, some contacts believe that a noticeable pickup will not occur until the fourth quarter. Manufacturing 
In a majority of Federal Reserve districts, manufacturing contacts report that, on balance, demand is strengthening very gradually. 
However, respondents in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco regions describe conditions as mixed, while those in Dallas and Boston note a recent softening in incoming orders. Although manufacturing inventories generally appear satisfactory, contacts in the Atlanta, Boston and Dallas districts note cases of unwelcome buildups. 
Producers of consumer goods and auto supplies are said to enjoy the greatest improvement in demand. Contacts in a number of districts report stronger orders for appliances, furniture, carpets, textiles and apparel, and for plastics, steel and parts for the auto makers. By contrast, the capital equipment industries remain relatively weak, 
according to the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and Philadelphia regions. Demand for oil field and agricultural machinery and products 
for aerospace was also described as soft. Exports are a source of strength in several coastal districts, but contacts in Dallas and 
Chicago mentioned slowdowns in exports of steel and agricultural equipment. 
The demand for labor in the manufacturing sector is stabilizing. Contacts in the Minneapolis and Atlanta districts report longer hours, 
while respondents in Chicago and St. Louis speak of smaller cutbacks and shutdowns averted (in steel and heavy-duty trucks). 
Input prices are generally said to be flat to down. According to Dallas district contacts, metals prices are down, chemicals prices are 
falling but at a slower rate, and lumber prices have stabilized after surging earlier in the year. Competition is forcing most manufacturers to maintain or reduce their selling prices. Retail respondents report few wage or wholesale cost pressures. 
Most manufacturers expect to see a gradual improvement in orders and production over the next three to six months. Producers of consumer durables generally believe the trough is behind them, while producers of capital goods and construction machinery say they are close to the bottom and expect a revival in the second half. Respondents from the steel and auto industries and the Boston district remain very cautious, however. Services and Related Industries 
Respondents in several districts report cost cutting efforts by service industries and state and local governments. In the New York 
district, mergers in the banking and airline industries are expected to 
cause sizable employment losses. In St. Louis, the trucking industry is retrenching, while weak economic growth in both Europe and North America is hurting express shipping. Contacts in the San Francisco region note employment losses in the professional services sector. In Dallas, however, engineering firms, business services, and temporary employment agencies report weak growth. The tourist business is improving in many parts of the nation. 
Real Estate and Construction The spring pickup in home sales appears to have moderated, with 
respondents in half the districts reporting a loss of momentum. In Minneapolis the slowing was attributed to increases in the cost of FHA mortgages; in contrast, the prospect of higher FHA costs was seen as a spur to sales in the Dallas district. Residential construction was said to be edging up in the Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts, 
steady in Richmond and mixed in Kansas City. Although contacts in the New York and Philadelphia districts have 
seen recent increases in commercial leasing activity, commercial real estate markets are weak across the country. Nonresidential construction 
is depressed by high vacancy rates and, according to contacts in New York and San Francisco, difficulties securing construction financing. Banking 
Loan demand from creditworthy businesses is generally said to be weak. In New York, banking contacts say they remain willing to lend to qualified business borrowers, but credit standards have tightened in recent months and borrowers' credit quality has declined. Philadelphia district banks are actively promoting business loans but are meeting slack demand from creditworthy borrowers. Moreover, Chicago respondents 
say that businesses are issuing long-term debt and are using improved cash flow to reduce their bank debt. However, Atlanta banking contacts report that improvements in customers' financial condition are resulting in slightly higher loan approval rates; in the Cleveland district lenders' interest in development loans has revived a bit. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Although Dallas and San Francisco report good conditions for most crops, hot, dry weather has reduced expected yields of corn, soybeans, and cotton in parts of the Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City districts. Contacts note that increased expenses, weak demand, and declining production prospects are clouding the outlook for farm incomes in some areas. Nevertheless, the cattle industry remains strong in all reporting regions, despite a recent drop in prices. 
Kansas City and Dallas contacts describe oil and gas activity as fairly stable. Rig counts remain low, and natural gas prices are at their lowest level in 12 years. In the San Francisco region, lumber 
industry conditions are said to have weakened in recent weeks. By contrast, St. Louis and Minneapolis lumber producers see better prospects.",0,1
1991-07-31,"Economic conditions appear to be improving modestly in much of the nation. Retail sales are up moderately in some districts. Manufacturing is 
gaining strength in some regions and industries, although several districts report weaker foreign demand for some manufactured goods. Prices are generally steady to up slightly at both the wholesale and retail levels. Home purchases continue to strengthen, but homebuilding has picked up in only a few regions. Mortgage lending continues to be the only source of strength in loan demand. Delayed planting could reduce production of some crops. Stable oil prices and low natural gas prices are keeping oil drilling in check. 
Consumer Spending Retail sales vary across districts. While there are no reports of 
substantial improvement, the overall situation is somewhat brighter than that described in the last Beige Book. A few districts describe gains as slight or moderate, while others report lackluster sales. Richmond reports a slight decline in sales, and Atlanta notes that spending increases of recent months have stalled. Sales are uneven in several districts, with soft goods selling better than consumer durables. But sales advances in the Chicago district were led by housing-related durable goods. Unseasonably warm weather has brought improved sales of summer goods in the Northeast, but skepticism remains about future gains. Retailers in several districts are also concerned 
* Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City based on information collected before June 10, 1991. This document summarizes comments 
received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii about future sales gains in light of shaky consumer confidence and uncertainty 
about the course of the economy. A few districts, however, report optimism about future sales, particularly for items related to purchases of both new and existing houses. While retailers in some districts are comfortable with current inventory levels, others continue to emphasize keeping stocks lean and under tight control. Only modest increases in retail prices are reported. Most reporting districts say that new car sales remain weak. 
Manufacturing Manufacturing activity seems to be improving overall, but several 
districts report slower export growth. Prices of inputs are generally stable. Philadelphia reports activity picking up in most major industries, and Boston 
notes a recent pickup in both sales and orders. Cleveland says that manufacturing output appears to have bottomed as capital goods industries near a trough, but New York and San Francisco report continued slow activity. Steel industry respondents see little change in production, with gradual improvement in domestic markets offset by softer export markets. St. Louis reports mixed activity with some firms expanding but many still contracting due to defense cuts spreading to smaller firms. In the Chicago district, consumer durables producers are doing better than heavy equipment producers. Automobile production is improving, as is production of goods going into new homes. Weakness continues in the production and sales of capital goods. Dallas reports that oil field machinery production has declined slightly due to decreased domestic drilling. 
Views of the outlook vary among respondents, with stagnation expected in the Boston district until early 1992 but healthy gains expected in the 
iii 
Philadelphia district for the rest of this year. New York respondents see no significant turnaround before late summer, while Cleveland and Richmond respondents are optimistic for the second half of the year. 
Construction and Real Estate The improvement in home sales reported in the last Beige Book continues 
and is being translated into increased construction activity in some areas. While buyer interest and purchases still are found mainly in the market for existing homes, reduced inventories of new houses are leading to increases in starts in several parts of the Midwest. In the Atlanta district, tight lending conditions are restricting the rebound in residential sales and construction. And in the St. Louis district, new construction remains mixed in spite of lower inventories of unsold homes. Nonresidential construction remains weak. Little commercial construction appears to be under way, as vacancy rates are high and leasing activity sluggish. Construction activity is being supported by public projects in the Atlanta and Richmond districts, but Dallas reports a significant slowdown in most types of public construction. 
Banking and Finance Bank lending continues to be weak in the eight districts reporting on 
financial developments, despite a pickup in demand for home mortgage loans. Much of the strength in mortgage lending stems from refinancing rather than 
new purchases. Demand for business and consumer loans is weak, except for some modest strength in consumer lending in the Cleveland and Kansas City districts. While sluggish growth in business loans in the Richmond district 
iv 
is attributed mainly to weak loan demand, some supply restraints were also noted. Small and midsized banks in the New York district report slower 
repayment for all types of consumer loans. Some respondents expect continued sluggish growth in lending even after the recession ends. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources Extreme weather conditions in several districts have hampered spring 
planting. Production estimates are being lowered for several crops. Heavy rains have delayed spring planting in parts of the Atlanta, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts. Crops affected include cotton, soybeans, peanuts, rice, corn, and grain sorghum. Dry conditions in west 
Texas and the Texas panhandle have reduced production estimates for the area's wheat and cotton crops. Richmond reports generally favorable agricultural 
prospects, and Minneapolis notes that conditions are good in the Dakotas. Kansas City reports a high level of farm income, with strong cattle prices continuing to reduce the impact of weak crop prices. 
Oil drilling in the Dallas and Kansas City districts has declined despite stable oil prices. The decline stems partly from low natural gas 
prices, which are down 20 percent from a year ago.",0,1
1991-05-31,"Economic activity remained weak in much of the nation, but 
there were some indications that the decline may be bottoming out. Retail sales were sluggish in most districts, with no sustained pickup following the end of the Persian Gulf war. Manufacturing showed indications of stabilizing, with some districts reporting slightly improved conditions and increased optimism about future activity. Other districts, however, report continued weakness in manufacturing. Wage increases appear modest and input prices in manufacturing are reported to be flat or down. Larger price increases continue, however, in certain service industries such as health care. Residential real estate activity improved across the nation, while non-residential construction remained weak. Loan demand was reported flat or slightly improving by most districts. Agricultural conditions outside of California are reported to be generally good. Stable oil prices and low natural gas prices are reducing exploration. 
Consumer Spending Retail sales remained sluggish in most districts, with the

ii confidence has yet to be translated into solid sales. Shoppers 
are remaining cautious and traffic is slow. Some softening of sales was reported by Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas. Cleveland reported a pickup in activity in areas not affected by auto layoffs, spurred in part by aggressive promotion. Increases also were noted in St. Louis for heavily promoted and discounted goods. Increased auto sales were noted by Kansas City, Cleveland, and Atlanta, but most districts reported little improvement and Dallas reported sharply reduced auto sales. 
Low expectations for a significant improvement in sales are reported in Philadelphia and New York. Boston reports that the prevailing expectation among retailers is that 1991 will continue to be a tough year. Atlanta notes that some retailers fear that increased activity in their district may be ""catch up"" spending and not permanent. San Francisco, however, reports that expectations for improved consumer spending rose substantially. Richmond also reports increased optimism among retailers. Retail inventories are reported to be lean in most districts. 
Manufacturing Manufacturing activity showed signs of bottoming out in much 
of the nation. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City all report stable or slightly improving conditions. Weaker conditions were reported by Dallas and St. Louis. Most districts report manufacturing input prices to be flat or down. 
iii Cleveland noted some slow recovery in auto production, while 
Chicago reported an increase in orders received by suppliers to the auto industry. St. Louis, however, reported continued 
layoffs in the auto sector and a plant shutdown expected in May. Cleveland reports that steel production is expected to remain at 
70 to 75 percent of capacity. Specialty steel and machine tool producers appear to be doing better than in previous recessions. 
Optimism among manufacturers for improvement was reported by Philadelphia, Richmond, and Cleveland. 
Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported strength in export activity. Richmond indicated that exports at District ports were higher than in the previous year and are expected to increase further. Boston, however, indicated disappointing export activity. Contacts in Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco expect orders related to the rebuilding of Kuwait. 
Construction and Real Estate Residential real estate activity improved across the nation, 
with most districts noting increased sales of new and existing single-family homes and modest improvements in residential construction. Increased buyer interest was attributed to renewed confidence following the end of the Persian Gulf war, and to the decline in mortgage interest rates. Atlanta, however, reported that some builders are skeptical whether the increased housing demand is sustainable. 
Nonresidential construction activity remains weak. Boston 
iv 
reported that construction of new commercial space has nearly ground to a halt, but that vacancy rates continue to increase due to further contraction in the financial services industry. New York reported that office leasing activity in midtown Manhattan declined to its lowest level in three years. Vacancy rates rose in downtown Manhattan with the addition of new space. High vacancy rates also were reported in Los Angeles and in Minneapolis/St. Paul. Dallas reported that construction activity remains sluggish, with respondents attributing weakness to tight credit conditions and uncertainty over the actions of the Resolution Trust Corporation. 
Banking and Finance Loan demand was reported to be flat or improving slightly in 
the eight districts reporting on financial developments. Increases were reported in mortgage lending and refinancings. Commercial and industrial loan demand was reported weak by Philadelphia, but slightly increasing by Richmond. In general, loan demand was expected to improve with the economy. 
Reports on credit availability are mixed. New York reports that a majority of their surveyed banks have not changed their credit standards over the last three months, but a few are more cautious with respect to land development loans. Atlanta reports that most contacts feel that tight lending conditions continue to restrict loan growth. Boston indicates that half of their contacts report that a lack of credit is hampering capital 
spending, while the other half report ample credit for projects such as renovations and computer upgrades. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources Dallas reported that prices for cotton, grain sorghum and 
soybeans have increased, and producers are indicating they will plant more acreage for these crops. According to Kansas City, 
warm weather has resulted in rapid development of the winter wheat crop, which is in generally good condition. Kansas City 
reports dry soil conditions in the western part of their district, and Minneapolis reports below normal precipitation in South Dakota. Favorable planting weather is reported by St. Louis and Richmond. In California, the freeze in late December cut citrus fruit production and exports in half and destroyed many fruit and nut trees. Continued drought conditions have caused farmers to cut back on acreage planted for many crops, including a 15 to 20 percent drop in cotton acreage planted in the San Joaquin valley. 
Kansas City reports that stable oil prices since the end of the Persian Gulf conflict have resulted in continued development of existing reserves, but current prices are not stimulating much exploration. Drilling activity fell in March but remained about 
13 percent above its year-ago level. Dallas reports dampened oil and gas production and drilling efforts. While oil prices are little changed from a year earlier, natural gas prices are the lowest in several years.",1,1
1991-04-30,"Economic activity remained soft in much of the nation but there were some indications that the decline may be slowing. The pattern of retail sales varied among districts with the majority reporting either sluggishness or results below planned levels. Retail inventories appear to be at satisfactory levels, except for some excess auto stocks. Manufacturing was sluggish in most of the country though several districts noted either a slight improvement or an easing of the downward 
trend. While construction activity continued weak, realtors and homebuilders reported an increase in buyer interest and, in some areas, purchases in recent weeks.

ii exhibited strength as did specialty stores in Philadelphia. Most 
districts reported that auto sales declined though Dallas and Atlanta noted some recent improvement. With the exception of some excess auto stocks, retail inventories generally appear to be at satisfactory levels. 
Retailers in most districts were hopeful that sales would improve with the cessation of hostilities in the Gulf but most did not anticipate strong gains until the economy rebounds and consumer confidence returns. 
Manu facturing Manufacturing activity was sluggish in most of the nation though 
several districts noted either a slight improvement or an easing of the downward trend. Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia and St. 
Louis stated that strength in the export sector was offsetting a part of the weak domestic demand and Atlanta and San Francisco noted that some manufacturers' orders had increased as a result of the Gulf war. Of the six districts reporting on manufacturing inventories, four mentioned excess levels and the need for further trimming while in the remaining two, stocks were generally satisfactory. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis described a slowdown in motor vehicle production, and, related to this, Chicago and Cleveland noted a decline in steel production as well. Other industries in which activity slowed were textiles, furniture and construction-related products. On the other hand, Cleveland noted that capital goods output was holding up fairly well, though in Chicago the picture was mixed, and Atlanta and St. Louis noted strength among food processors. 
iii Dallas described the production of oil field equipment as growing 
strongly. With regard to the outlook, contacts in Boston and Philadelphia anticipate an improvement in three to six months and 
manufacturers in the Richmond district are optimistic about the future for the first time in several months. 
Construction and Real Estate While construction activity continued weak in most of the nation, 
eight districts noted that realtors and homebuilders have reported an increase in buyer interest and, in some areas, purchases in recent 
weeks. The pickup is attributed to lower mortgage interest rates and more attractive home prices. Despite the pickup, however, most districts report that homebuilding activity remains slow and participants are only cautiously optimistic that some improvement over last year's slow pace will occur. Nonresidential construction also remained weak and with vacancy rates continuing to rise on office and retail space, contacts in most districts do not anticipate a turnaround. However, Dallas noted that several large commercial projects have begun and that petrochemical plant construction is robust. 
Banking and Finance Loan demand continued soft in the nine districts reporting on 
financial developments although mortgage refinancing has increased with the decline in mortgage interest rates. Both consumer and business loan demand are weak and lenders do not anticipate a rebound until overall economic conditions improve. Consumers are reportedly reluctant to add 
new debt given the uncertainties about the employment situation, and firms aremaintaininglowinventoriesandreducingcapitalspending. 
iv However, St. Louis noted that some companies that normally obtain 
funding in the commercial paper market have been inquiring about bank financing. Meanwhile, lenders in some districts have tightened terms for borrowers particularly in the construction and real estate sectors. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Dallas reported that agricultural income prospects improved due to good cotton, rice and peanut harvests and continuing strong beef prices. Kansas City noted that weak grain prices limited the income of crop producers but that the income of livestock producers was bolstered by lowfeedpricesandcontinuedstrengthincattleandhogprices. The Minnesota index of prices received by farmers fell for the ninth consecutive month to the lowest level since 1988. San Francisco noted that the fifth year of drought in California will result in reduced production of field crops and increased production costs. Moreover, higher feed prices and a lack of adequate grazing land will force cattle into feedlots early, thereby lowering livestock prices. 
Lower oil prices and uncertainty about the future have caused drilling activity in Kansas City to subside though the rig count is 
still about 3 percent above a year ago. Energy sector activity remained strong in Dallas where oil companies expect demand for their services to increase as Kuwait rebuilds its oil fields. Oil production in the Atlanta district was stable. San Francisco and St. Louis report that the wood products industry has weakened in response to slow overall economic activity. Mining industry conditions have been fairly good in Minneapolis with 1990 iron ore production up 5 percent, but coal productionin St. Louis has declined.",0,1
1991-02-28,"The level of economic activity appears to be declining in most districts. The Persian Gulf situation is frequently cited as a key determinant of both current and future economic activity. Nominal retail sales during the holiday season differed little from a year earlier. Inventories are near their desired levels. Despite continued export growth, manufacturing orders, employment and shipments have weakened. Construction activity continues to slow in most districts, and interest rate declines have done little to stimulate residential housing demand. Inflation does not appear to be accelerating. Widespread weakness exists in home sales and consumer and business loan demand. Some state and local governments are experiencing revenue shortfalls. Farm income prospects have weakened somewhat, while the mining sector shows strength. Consumer Spending 
Nominal retail sales during the holiday season were near year-earlier levels, implying declines in real terms. Sales of big-ticket items were particularly weak. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas mention that price discounting was used to move goods. Despite the reported dampening effect of the Persian Gulf conflict throughout the holiday

season, some Districts noted improved sales toward the end of December. 
Most districts that mention inventories report they are generally near desiredlevels. The outlook for retail sales in most districts is for continued sluggishness, with retailers in Philadelphia and Cleveland not expecting any upturn before the third quarter of this year. 
Four districts indicate that car sales are weakening or lower than a 
year earlier while Dallas indicates increasing sales, especially in the Houstonarea. Auto inventories are moderate to high in the Minneapolis 
district, while Kansas City reports that dealers are trimming their inventories. Cleveland indicates that domestic car dealers are not adding to their inventories, in contrast to their Japanese counterparts 
who are increasing inventories in anticipation of higher spring sales. Manufacturing 
Nearly all districts report weak or declining manufacturing 
activity. While domestic demand is generally weakening, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco indicate that export growth continues to be strong, or at least stronger than domestic growth. Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis note a downturn in auto production that had spread to related sectors. Cleveland and Chicago, for example, note sharp declines in steel production. Boston and St. Louis report that layoffs are expected among defense contractors, and San Francisco reports that defense-related aerospace activity remains weak. The outlook for the manufacturing sector is clouded by the Persian Gulf situation, with some districts indicating that the timing of an upturn is dependent on a resolution of that conflict. Contacts in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas districts, however, do not expect a turnaround before the third quarter. 
Construction and Real Estate Despite pockets of strength, most districts describe residential and 
nonresidential construction activity as down more than usual for this time of year. Housing starts are below year-ago levels in most districts, and high and climbing vacancy rates in many large urban areas have discouraged commercial office space development. Contacts in the Dallas district, however, report a modest increase in construction activity, especially in Houston and South Texas. Recent declines in interest rates and home prices have done little to buoy demand for new or existing homes in most districts. Contacts cite uncertainty about the future course of economic activity and the Persian Gulf crisis as the major factors dampening residential housing demand. New York reports that some district lenders and developers have held auctions to pare housing inventories. 
Prices Several districts report little evidence of increasing inflation. 
San Francisco reports that wage and price increases continue to slow, and Minneapolis notes that they have remained moderate. Cleveland contacts expect the inflation rate to decline from recent levels. Manufacturing input and output prices are generally stable, although Richmond reports increased raw materials prices. Districts report declining oil and natural gas prices, but mixed movements in motor fuel prices. Grain prices are generally falling, while beef, citrus and log prices are showing strength. 
Banking and Finance 
The majority of districts report weakness in business and consumer loan demand, largely due to the slowdown in the economy and the Persian Gulf. Real estate lending is edging downward in many districts, despite 
declines in mortgage interest rates. Commercial real estate and construction lending are especially weak. Atlanta reports that many 
businesses have reduced or delayed planned capital expenditures. Cleveland notes that signs of consumer financial difficulties are emerging, as evidenced by increases in auto repossessions and home foreclosures in some parts of the district. 
State and Local Government Finance State and local governments in the New York, Richmond, St. Louis and 
Dallas districts are either expecting or experiencing revenue shortfalls because of weakening economic conditions. In some cases, increased government spending was also cited as contributing to the governments' 
financial strain. A variety of measures, including reduced spending and layoffs, are being taken or are anticipated to avoid budget deficits. Agriculture and Natural-Resource-Related Industries 
Kansas City and Richmond indicate that farm income prospects for 1991 have dimmed because of an expected cost-price squeeze. Chicago notes that agricultural exports have fallen sharply in recent months. A 
recent freeze and a continuing drought are causing major problems for 
California's agricultural sector. Winter grain crops are reported to be in good condition, although Minneapolis notes potential problems later this year because of below-normal precipitation this winter. 
Energy extraction has increased in the Dallas and St. Louis districts, while Kansas City indicates that growth in the the number of operating drilling rigs has leveled off. Minneapolis reports that conditions in the mining industry have been fairly good. San Francisco, St. Louis and Atlanta report weak or declining activity in the forest products industries.",0,1
1990-11-30,"Economic activity appears to have grown slowly inmost Federal Reserve districts since early August, but seems to have declined somewhat in others. 
Many districts reported a weakening in business and consumer confidence. Retail sales, including new car sales, were sluggish or down in most of the country. Indicators of manufacturing activity were mixed to weaker. Commercial and residential construction declined, although sales of homes rose in some areas. Total loan demand at commercial banks was lackluster, and businesslendingdecreasedacrossthenation. Inagriculture,cropyieldsand livestock prices were generally strong, although various factors detracted from farm sector conditions in some areas. With respect to energy, higher oil prices appeared to be stimulating oil drilling, although some shortages of skilled workers were reported. 
Retail Trade Retail activity apparently weakened in most of the nation. All 
districts except Chicago reported that sales grew more slowly or declined. Many noted slower sales of durable goods, particularly autos, and some 
indicated that retailers had laid off workers. Retailers generally believed their inventories were at satisfactory levels, although some had begun to trim their stocks. 
Most districts reported that retailers were generally pessimistic about their sales prospects in coming months. The retailers blamed lower consumer confidence brought on by greater uncertainty and higher fuel prices for the

current and expected weakness in their sales. Some worried that they would have to discount prices significantly to move merchandise. Industrial Activity 
Conditions in the manufacturing sector apparently weakened somewhat. Chicago reported relatively strong activity, but most other districts gave 
mixed reports or indicated declines. Weakness was evident across most industries, although several districts reported boosts in energy- or defense- related production. Reports received from six districts indicated that, on balance, manufacturing employment declined. No district indicated serious manufacturer concern over inventory levels, although Philadelphia and Kansas City noted that producers were reducing inventories. Exports from the Richmond and Cleveland Districts rose but those from the Chicago and Boston Districts fell. Scattered reports on producer prices suggested that prices of raw materials rose while finished goods prices were relatively stable. 
Manufacturers in several districts were concerned about their business prospects in the coming months. Some planned further reductions in employment and were cautious about their capital spending plans. Construction and Real Estate 
Most districts reported slower construction activity. Scarce financing and earlier overbuilding were associated with abrupt declines in starts of commercial buildings and residential developments in several metropolitan areas. New York observed that reduced commercial construction was expected to help ease the vacancy rate inmidtown Manhattan. 
Housing starts were reported to be down in most districts, but home sales registered increases in several. Six districts noted general weakness in residential construction, although multi-family activity was higher in the Dallas district. Home sales rose in at least parts of five districts, but 
Atlanta and San Francisco reported general declines. Some districts commented on home prices. Atlanta and San Francisco 
indicated that the median home price had declined from a year ago. New York attributed unsold homes to unrealistic pricing. Financial 
Activity in the financial sector was generally softer. Several districts reported that some financial institutions had tightened their 
lending standards, especially for real estate loans, because of uncertain economic prospects or higher capital requirements. Total loan demand was 
unchanged to lower in most districts. The demand for commercial and industrial loans was weak across the nation, while the demand for consumer loans was mixed. Many districts indicated that loans to commercial real estate developers were down. Agriculture 
The agricultural sector was generally strong across the country. Several districts noted that yields of most crops were expected to be good, 
and Minneapolis and Kansas City indicated that higher livestock prices and low feed costs would help support farm income. In the St. Louis and Richmond 
Districts, recent rains and cold weather caused some delays in harvest activity and damaged soybeans somewhat. Also, several districts reported that low crop prices or higher production costs might limit the incomes of some farmers intheir areas. 
Three districts reported on farm lending activity. Kansas City reported that the demand for agricultural loans rose, and Chicago and Richmond reported 
a good pace of repayments on agricultural loans. Energy 
Several districts reported on energy-related developments. Kansas City 
iv 
noted increased oil drilling activity, and Dallas and San Francisco expected an increase soon. Atlanta and San Francisco indicated shortages of skilled labor in their oil-producing regions. St. Louis observed that higher fuel prices were being blamed for cutbacks in the transportation sector, and Boston and Chicago noted transportation surcharges resulting from these higher prices. Richmond and St. Louis indicated that coal production was up, although coal prices were mostly unchanged.",0,1
1990-10-31,"Economic activity is expanding more slowly or declining in most Federal Reserve districts, but several districts report continued, modest growth. Weakness is most apparent in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic districts. Although patterns of consumer spending vary widely among districts, rates of increase are generally slowing. The districts' assessments of manufacturing activity range from moderate expansion to absolute declines. On average, however, there seems to be little movement in orders or production. Signs of aconstructiondownturnarewidespread,butnotuniversal. Whiledrought persists in some agricultural areas, soil moisture conditions are good or at least improved in most reporting districts. So far, the recent increase in oil prices has not affected domestic oil and gas drilling. Several district reports of credit markets focus on soft loan demand and some district banks offer examples of tighter credit conditions. Consumer Spending 
Retail sales patterns vary widely among districts, but growth appears to be ebbing. While Minneapolis cites ""good"" sales increases, Atlanta and Boston note flat to modest expansion. New York and Philadelphia report absolute declines in dollar volumes from a year earlier. Sales of big ticket items are said to be particularly soft, but clothing sales continue to show strength in some districts. Several districts mention the negative impacts of higher

ii oil prices. Despite demand weakness in some districts, most retailers say 
their inventories are at desired levels. Auto sales are up in Minneapolis and Cleveland but are weak or slowing 
inAtlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. One district says that credit tightening has caused some potential auto buyers difficulty in finding financing. Manufacturing 
Demand for manufactured products shows little overall change ineither direction. Minneapolis and San Francisco characterize their manufacturing sectors' performances as mixed, while growth inAtlanta ismoderate except for construction and auto-related products. Orders to Boston, Richmond and Philadelphia firms are down, and sales have not changed lately in the Dallas District. 
Sales patterns differ greatly among industries. Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco mention strength indemand for primary metals, while Boston and Dallas note weakness in orders for computer, and some construction-related products. Some districts report increased producer uncertainty about future demand. 
In some cases, export demand appears to be stronger than domestic sales. Richmond notes exports of manufactures as among the few district manufacturing indicators that are not negative. Minneapolis says that strong foreign demand 
for producers' equipment has more than compensated for declines in domestic orders. In the Boston district, however, export sales are below a year earlier. 
With respect to changing costs of operation, a number of districts cite rising freight costs inthe wake of energy price hikes. Several districts, 
iii including Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago report increasing prices of 
inputs, but Atlanta reports prices of industrial commodities as steady. Construction and Real Estate 
References to declining construction activity and weakening real estate markets are common. Increases in homebuilding in the Dallas and Minneapolis 
markets are exceptions, but Minneapolis also notes marked declines in overall construction contract values in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. While Kansas City mentions recent upturns in housing starts, homebuilding there remains below a year earlier. According to the San Francisco report, construction activity is slowing in many parts of the west. Moreover, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis and New York all refer to weakening residential construction or weak housing sales and Cleveland notes high office and retail vacancy rates. Several reports say that respondents expect continued construction weakness in the near future. 
Agriculture 
Reports on agricultural production are generally positive, in part, because the soil moisture problems mentioned in the last beige book have ameliorated. IntheRichmondDistrict,rainfallinAugustwasmostlyabove normal and soil moisture levels are now said to be adequate, but the dry weather in June has lowered corn yields. The Dallas District reports that rainfall has improved soil conditions there. Crop conditions are also good in the Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts. Inadequate soil moisture continues to impede crop development in portions of the St. Louis district. The St. Louis and Dallas districts discuss the negative effects upon rice prices of the embargo on sales to Iraq. St. Louis also notes that recent increases in freight and insurance costs have discouraged exports to other 
iv Middle Eastern countries. Several district reports mention generally falling 
grain prices. Energy 
Despite marked increases inoil prices inthe wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, reporting districts say they have seen few effects on drilling so far. Dallas and Kansas City note recent declines indrilling activity, although the rig count remains above ayear earlier inboth districts. Moreover, industry observers in both districts say they do not expect the recent price shock to have much of an effect until oil prices remain high for an extended period and natural gas prices rise as well. Finance and Credit 
Most reporting districts say that lending activity is soft. Atlanta, Cleveland, and Philadelphia all mention recent slowdowns in lending, while New York notes signs of weaker demand for business loans. St. Louis cites slow loan growth at the large banks, but Kansas City district bankers report moderate increases in loan demand - including demand for commercial and industrial, consumer, and home mortgage loans. Financial organizations in several districts note tightening credit policies for at least some borrower groups. Banks' and thrifts' concerns over the viability of economic growth is said to have discouraged some lending",0,0
1990-08-31,"Business and banking contacts in the Reserve Districts generally report continued economic growth, though most noted that the pace was slow or had slackened recently. Among those Districts whose respondents commented on costs or prices, wages were reported as rising in a range of 3 to 5 percent, in most cases excluding benefits. Reports on prices did not display as much consensus, with some reporting widespread increases and others noting difficulty in passing on cost increases and attendant pressures on margins. Retail sales were generally described as a little better than a year ago or soft, with weaker-than-expected demand for big ticket items cited most often. In some Districts retailers indicated they had become less optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year, though in others they were anticipating a slight pickup in sales. 
Manufacturing activity is said to be flat, on balance, though healthy growth in tradeable goods is seen in a number of regions. Reports on real estate construction and sales suggest, for the most part, that activity is remaining below levels seen in 1989, largely because of continuing high inventories. Credit is said to be tight 
in some areas. However, little uniformity of opinion about the reasons for this was evident in the reports. Contacts in the 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and based on information collected before July 27, 1990. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
ii agriculture and natural resource sectors indicate a pretty good outlook at this point, reflecting better weather conditions in major crop and livestock producing areas and an improved energy 
sector. 
CONSUMER SPENDING 
Retail sales activity is described as soft to a little higher than a year ago, though contacts in Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas noted strength in some areas. Retailers in New York City are less optimistic about the outlook given the continuing layoffs at banks and brokerage firms, while those in St. Louis expressed similar views in light of anticipated defense cutbacks. 
Several Districts reported that demand for women's apparel in recent months was described as strong, while that for men's was weak. A few noted that sales activity in July had fallen off, though retailers in the Philadelphia District indicated that this 
was seasonal. Those in New York and Minneapolis remarked that an influx of Canadian shoppers was adding to sales in their Districts, while Dallas reported that retail activity in Houston and areas near the Mexican border was doing well. Reports on sales of home furnishings and appliances more frequently cited weakness, though there were exceptions to this. Vehicular sales were generally said to be flat or below year-ago levels, though contacts in Atlanta and 
San Francisco reported strong demand for used models. Of Districts that inquired about inventories, five cited indications that they were higher than retail respondents desired, 
iii while four noted that they were at levels acceptable 
to them. Kansas City added that financing for inventories is adequate. 
MANUFACTURING
Contacts at manufacturing firms suggest that overall activity is flat, though responses varied considerably from industry to industry. Strength was reported in demand for products that are exported, and Richmond added that producers are looking to these markets for sales gains. Demand for domestic steel was also said to be stronger, and respondents in Dallas and Cleveland said that this reflected the reduced availability of imports given healthy demand in Europe. Current levels of auto production were also cited as a reason for the better demand for steel. Chicago noted that orders for liner board were stronger than contacts had expected. 
With the exception of steel and commercial aircraft, backlogs 
and lead times were said to be working down. Minneapolis, and San Francisco noted that weakness was described as pronounced in defense-related activities. Dallas, Richmond, and Atlanta contacts saw weakness in textiles and furniture production. 
Of Districts reporting on employment and price trends, most respondents indicated that labor utilization was either flat or likely to weaken based on announced layoffs. Wage increases appeared clustered in a 3-5 percent range, though two Districts 
noted that the benefit costs were rising faster, and two mentioned shortages of entry-level workers. Reports on materials prices were mixed, with stability to slight increases noted by some contacts 
St. Louis, 
iv and flat to slight declines mentioned by others. Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis said costs and prices were generally rising, and contacts in the latter put the cost increases in 
a 3-5 percent range. CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE 
Reports on residential real estate construction and sales generally suggest that activity was below the pace of a year ago. High inventories of housing were said to be causing weakness in construction and in many cases causing downward pressure on prices. Cleveland, however, noted a mixed picture for sales, adding that prices were up in some cities by 6-8 percent over the last six months. St. Louis reported good demand for starter homes in the Memphis area. New York and Chicago realtors suggested that high- priced homes were the most difficult to sell. Respondents in San Francisco noted that a cooling of activity in coastal California dominated statistics for that District. Those in Boston indicated that the widespread media attention given to weakness in the District may be hurting real estate sales. 
Five Districts reported asking about nonresidential construction, and most respondents saw weak or slackening activity in their regions due to large inventories of space. Some in New York added that, while rent concessions had increased leasing 
activity in Manhattan, corporate relocations had led to a rise in vacancy rates anyway, in contrast to stable or declining ones elsewhere in the District. Firms polled by Dallas indicated that 
V 
construction of petrochemical plants remains at a high level, and Atlanta respondents viewed public infrastructure as a bright spot. FINANCE AND CREDIT 
Several Districts report that the pace of commercial loan growth has recently slowed, and some indicate that its levels are below those of a year ago. Lending to consumers appears to have decelerated by a smaller margin in most Districts that reported on this, with current growth attributable largely to credit card and home equity lending. Respondents in several Districts indicate that new credit is more difficult to obtain for construction projects, though their remarks suggest some divergence of view as to the causes of this.. In New York, the glut of homes for sale is said to be the major deterrent to building, even though the shortage of finance for acquisition and construction loans appears to be spreading. Regulatory restrictions on S&Ls are said to be affecting small builders in Chicago, though Cleveland notes that a shift from thrifts has caused real estate lending to rise at banks. They also add that while increased borrower scrutiny is reported, there are few known outright cancellations. 
About half the respondents in Boston saw the availability of bank credit as problematical for their own or other businesses. San Francisco notes similar views by a few respondents, though 
businesses and bankers in the District disagree about the extent of tighter standards and its impact on lending activity. Businesses in the Atlanta and Philadelphia Districts note problems with 
collecting on receivables. 
vi 
AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
District reports suggest that the outlook for agricultural production generally appears good at this point, though poor weather conditions are hurting crops in some areas. Kansas City indicates that wheat production in Kansas, the largest producing state, is the highest on record and more than twice last year's output. Prices are down sharply. St. Louis reports that wheat yields are lower by 12 to 26 percent due to disease. Chicago said that heavy rains earlier in the year had delayed planting. While Richmond said that rain brought relief to earlier drought conditions, Atlanta reported that hot and dry weather is reducing corn, soybean, and forage production by as much as 25 percent. Dallas also said that District crops, including cotton, corn and grains, were adversely affected by the heat and that prices in June averaged 6 percent above those a year earlier. Minneapolis noted that production costs for corn and soybeans were up 6-10 percent 
from last year. The Districts reporting on meat production said output and 
prices were both strong, and Atlanta described robust conditions for poultry with export sales especially healthy. Minneapolis indicated that forest products were doing well. San Francisco, in contrast, said that a widely expected deterioration in logging and lumber had emerged due to weaker housing construction and environmental concerns. Kansas City and Dallas noted that oil 
production was up from a year ago.",1,0
1990-07-31,"The tone of District reports suggests continued slow growth in the economy with little change in the underlying inflation rate. Reports on the 
behavior of consumption are mixed, and construction is indicated to be softening further. Capital goods industries are, on balance, pointing toward 
growth, and manufacturing is expected to strengthen in several Districts. Recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in several 
Districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent months, and are expected to remain so in the short term. It is unclear how much of the recent softness in retail sales represents temporary factors, such as unusual weather over the last several months. 
Both residential and nonresidential construction have been edging downward in recent months in most Districts, and indicators of future construction 
suggest further softening. Prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a result of 
ample rainfall in previously drought-stricken regions of the country, but cool, wet weather has delayed planting by as much as several weeks. 
* Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and based on information collected before June 8, 1990. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
The slow-growth economy is accompanied by an easing in demand for credit. Real estate loans, consumer loans, and business loans are still growing, but at reduced rates in recent months. Lenders are reported to have tightened standards especially for real estate loans, but there is still little information that suggests credit restraint is spreading into other markets. CONSUMER SPENDING 
District reports suggest very little growth, if not a decline, in real consumer spending for durable and nondurable goods this quarter from last. Retail sales have been marked by sluggish behavior in several Districts that has apparently continued into May and early June (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Richmond and St. Louis). 
Unseasonably cold and wet weather has reduced demand for summer goods and for apparel. Weakness in home furnishings is attributed to softened conditions in housing. 
Retail sales in Atlanta, Dallas, and Minneapolis apparently continued to increase in May, but at a reduced pace from earlier this year. Kansas City 
described retail sales as having increased moderately over the past three months, and San Francisco described sales as ""continuing healthy."" 
Several Districts reported that retail inventories are either high, or larger than desired (Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City). 
Retailers in several Districts are cautious about the short-term outlook for retail sales. In Boston and Cleveland, respondents apparently expect little improvement at least through the summer months, and Philadelphia reports that some retailers are lowering their sales forecasts. 
MANUFACTURING Manufacturing production has been relatively flat over the last few 
months, but several Districts expect strengthening in output despite softness in some industries. Defense, building construction machinery, and apparel indsutries are experiencing some softening. In contrast, the aerospace industry is a source of strength in several regions of the country, (Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco), and the energy sector is expanding (Dallas and Kansas City). 
Capital goods industries still point toward growth, despite mixed performance. Construction machinery, excluding building, is ""doing well,"" agricultural machinery is strong, and orders for communications equipment are rising, according to Chicago. Demand for heating and air conditioning and industrial pumps is strong in Atlanta, and capital goods is ""surprisingly strong"" in Minneapolis. Cleveland reports that capital spending plans are stronger than reported in the latest Commerce Department survey, which should be an important support to manufacturing output. 
Output in the auto and auto-related industries, such as glass and rubber, has been a drag on manufacturing in Atlanta, but Chicago and Cleveland note some strengthening in auto production that should add to total output this quarter and perhaps next. Steel production has rebounded, and some analysts have upgraded their steel outlook for 1990 (Chicago). CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE 
In most Districts, except San Francisco and Minneapolis, residential and nonresidential construction has been flat to declining in recent months, with prospects for further easing. Housing sales were either flat or fell in recent months in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City, but were generally 
stronger in Minneapolis, and rebounded in California. Housing sales have been increasing at double-digit rates in Oregon, Idaho, and Utah. 
Contract awards for future starts fell in April in Chicago and Dallas, and permits in Minnesota were off 20% in March from a year earlier. Atlanta notes that contracts for both residential and commercial construction continue to slow, in part because of overbuilt markets. 
An underlying problem in commercial construction is an apparent excess supply of new office space in many parts of the country. Commercial 
construction in downtown Manhattan is marked by the highest office vacancy in two decades. Dallas notes that office occupancy rates in major 
metropolitan centers in that District have been increasing, but are still low. AGRICULTURE 
Recent rains in the Southeast, the North Central states, and California generally relieved drought conditions and appear to have improved farm crop yields. Richmond reports that grain yields are expected to be normal to above normal. Recent rains in the North Central states ""substantially brightened prospects for agriculture,"" especially in Minnesota and North Dakota, and ranchers in Montana expect a record year this year (Minneapolis). Kansas reports heavy spring rains ended the drought of the past two years and boosted prospects for winter wheat output. Expected yields range from average to well above average, with record yields likely in much of that state. Recent rains in California have relieved some of the drought conditions, but storms have caused significant damage to some fruit crops. 
Heavy rainfalls in the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts however, have damaged crops and delayed other crop planting by several weeks. Below-normal temperatures and above-normal rainfall since 
mid-May have delayed planting of an estimated 13% of corn acreage and 47% of soybean acreage as of June 2, according to Chicago. St. Louis reports that poor weather and disease and insect problems suggest that 1990 crop yields may fall below normal in some parts of that District. Moreover, an estimated one-fourth to one-half of the wheat and cotton crop is rated as in poor to very poor condition in several states. 
CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS Loan demand continues to expand, although the pace has eased for most 
types of loans. Philadelphia reports easing in growth for most loans, and Atlanta comments that weak loan growth has led lenders to encourage borrowing. Home equity loans continue to rise in New York and Richmond, although growth in Philadelphia has slowed along with other kinds of consumer loans. 
Constraints on credit seem to be primarily in real estate, although limited information suggests small business firms in some areas may also be affected. New York notes that home builders report a shortage of credit for 
acquisition and construction loans is becoming a major problem, especially in downstate New York and northern New Jersey. Cleveland points out that credit restraint is largely confined to multi-family construction and commercial buildings, but that there appears to be ample funds for single-family housing. San Francisco reports that ""lending standards have become more stringent in recent months,"" and both Richmond and St. Louis reported about credit constraints for the first time this month.",0,0
1990-05-31,"District reports indicate that overall economic activity continues to expand slowly in April. The agriculture sector reports some weather-related damage to specific crops, but 
drought fears have been alleviated by recent rains, and the farm outlook is generally optimistic. Natural resource industries are generally reported to be healthy, with exploration and drilling holding up well in the oil and gas industry. Residential real estate markets remain generally weak, but with some specific geographic areas doing well. Nonresidential construction is mixed, with public works projects supplying some strength. Manufacturing is also mixed, with some improvement noted in half of the districts. Plants are still apparently operating below capacity, however, and there has been little upward pressure on industrial prices. Retail spending has been growing slowly in general, and merchants are looking for small real gains throughout the rest of the year. Auto sales, however, remain weak. In the financial sector, demand for loans is varied but generally flat, with loans for commercial real estate down in most districts. There is little evidence that a general ""credit crunch"" is developing; the majority of businesses say they have not seen any change in credit terms and have had no trouble getting credit. Where credit tightening by banks and thrift institutions has been noted, however, it has mainly affected newer small businesses and the real estate industry. 
AGRICULTURE 
The cold, wet weather that dominated much of the nation through spring took its toll on some crops. Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis say apple and peach crops were 
damaged, in some cases severely, and inclement weather has delayed field work and planting in the Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts. However, soil moisture levels have now reached adequate, or even surplus, levels in most areas, with the exception of some parts of the Minneapolis district and California. 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and based on information collected before April 20, 1990. This document summarizes comments received from businesses and 
other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Although winter wheat sustained some weather-related damage in the Richmond and St. Louis districts, Minneapolis says losses were small in that district, and farmers in contact with Kansas City and Dallas are optimistic about the wheat crop this year. 
Atlanta and St. Louis say farmers intend to plant more cotton, rice, and soybeans this year. Atlanta adds that higher cotton and grain prices may bring some previously idled land back into production. NATURAL RESOURCES 
Although oil and gas prices have fallen from year-ago levels, they remain at a level high enough to encourage continued drilling and exploration, according to Kansas City and 
Dallas. Dallas says the industry is ""healthy""; Kansas City reports that the rig count, while down from the February level, is higher than a year ago; Atlanta says domestic drilling is 
holding steady and that no change is expected. Minneapolis says mining, especially for precious metals, remains strong. Atlanta 
and St. Louis both report increased coal exports. Forest product industries are also healthy, according to San Francisco and Minneapolis, although concern about environmental issues is causing uncertainty about expansion plans. REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION 
Housing remains weak in most parts of the nation, with multifamily activity relatively weaker than single-family activity. Although a recent weather-related increase in activity is noted by several districts, no signs of a sustained turnaround are evident. Housing prices remain generally sluggish and are reported by Boston and New York to be falling further; New York, however, indicates that price declines are confined to the New York metropolitan area. Real estate activity in Michigan has been weak also as a result of softness in the auto industry. Pockets of strength in real estate are reported in Minneapolis-St. Paul, in parts of California, and in upstate and western New York. Although industry representatives expect some improvement in 1990, most anticipate a slow year, with sales dampened in part by tighter credit standards imposed by banks. 
Nonresidential activity is mixed. In Atlanta, the office market remains ""subdued,"" New York says the pace of leasing is good (but that renters are getting significant 
iii 
concessions), and Dallas says the nonresidential market is weak. Atlanta and Philadelphia report strength in public construction projects. 
MANUFACTURING Manufacturing activity is mixed across the nation; a majority of the districts report 
some improvement, or expectations of improvement, in the coming quarters. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco all indicate that industrial activity is increasing. St. Louis says the sector is weak, while Boston and Philadelphia report mixed conditions. New orders and shipments are up in most districts, although no general upward pressure on industrial prices is noted. Those areas that mention inventories indicate that they are in line with expectations; no district report indicates that stock levels are excessive. 
Chicago says auto production is leading the pickup, despite continued sluggishness in sales, and that all auto facilities are expected to be operating by the end of April. Cleveland agrees that the auto industry is rebounding, but says contacts in that region still expect second-quarter output to be lower than a year ago. Other strong industries include apparel (Atlanta), steel (Chicago), and various capital goods (Chicago). The commercial aerospace industry is also among the stronger industries in the Boston and San Francisco districts. Atlanta, however, says there is concern in the southeast that the industry may soon show weakness in that region as a result of possible Defense Department cutbacks. Several Districts say auto-related products are still in the doldrums. 
The outlook for the industrial sector is improving. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia region say they expect a pickup within six months and are planning to boost capital spending. Cleveland's report indicates that the ""worst of the production cutbacks are over."" Manufacturers in the Richmond area are also more optimistic; a recent survey indicates that developments in Eastern Europe are expected to give sales a push over the next two years, but that most businesses will benefit later rather than sooner. 
CONSUMER SPENDING Retail sales vary by district, but reports generally reflect slow, positive growth. Sales 
growth was strongest in the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts 
and weakest in St. Louis and Dallas. Kansas City says sales are above year-ago levels but have been mixed recently. Philadelphia and Chicago note that sales gains in their areas have been achieved without resorting to promotions or markdowns. Retailers generally say inventories are in line with projected sales. 
Apparel has been an especially strong seller in most districts. Hard goods, such as furniture, appliances, and other household items, while strong in some areas, are contributing less to overall growth. 
The outlook for consumer spending also varies by region, but retailers are generally looking for modest gains in 1990 as a whole. Boston merchants say 1990 will be ""difficult,"" 
and contacts in Philadelphia say they are looking for niches; they do not anticipate a broad-based surge in sales this year. Only in St. Louis are store managers overtly pessimistic, expecting the softness noted in that region to continue throughout the year. There is some concern in several districts that unseasonably warm weather led to sales that were borrowed, in part, from the second quarter, and that second-quarter sales will now suffer as a result. In addition, the uncertain outlook for the housing sector is blurring the outlook for sales of household goods and making many merchants cautious in developing projections. 
Auto sales are reported to be spotty but generally weak across the nation, and little improvement is expected in the near future. The profitability of auto dealers also varies. Atlanta reports that, while many dealers are increasing profits and some popular models are in short supply, some small dealers in rural areas have gone out of business. FINANCIAL 
Total loan demand varies by district but is generally flat. In Philadelphia and St. Louis, loan volume is higher, while San Francisco and Kansas City say volume is stable. Richmond reports a slight increase in problem loans. Activity in specific categories also varies by District. In Philadelphia, business loans, especially to manufacturers, are leading the growth noted there, while New York says business loans to retailers have been providing strength. In St. Louis, business loans in general have been growing, along with loans in other categories as well. However, most districts report that commercial real estate 
loans are down because of a number of factors: tightened lending requirements, more scrutiny by regulators, overbuilding in many markets, and locally sluggish economies. 
Credit Conditions. Although virtually every District cites some specific cases of credit tightening by banks, with the most significant action taken by New England banks, there is little evidence of a general ""credit crunch."" Many banks have reviewed lending policies in recent months, cutting back on loans to the real estate industry and newer small businesses, or tightening up lending requirements by increasing collateral requirements or shortening loan terms. In addition, many builders are having a more difficult time securing financing because of the new lending limits in the thrift industry. Still, the majority of businesses say they have not seen any change in credit terms, and have not had trouble getting loans.",0,1
1990-04-30,"Summary. Most Federal Reserve Districts describe economic activity as expanding slowly. Consumer spending varies from moderate to strong, except for auto sales which have slowed after a January rebound. The manufacturing sector is soft, but is improving in some Districts. The weakness in autos and auto-related industries, however, is widespread. Construction activity continues to slow in most Districts, but Chicago and San Francisco still are reporting relatively strong activity. Agricultural conditions are generally good, although several Districts cite serious concern over the lack of soil moisture. Banks have become less aggressive in making new loans, and demand for most types of loans has softened. 
Consumer Spending. Retail sales have continued to improve in recent months. Most Districts indicate that retail sales gains in February were above a year ago, led by women's apparel and electronics. Cleveland and San Francisco note that retailers are reporting better- than-expected sales gains. However, retail sales in New England are weak, partly due to consumers turning cautious. Sales of ""big ticket"" items in Richmond are flat and demand for durable goods in Atlanta is weak. Most Districts report that retailers have inventories under control, although Chicago and Cleveland report downward pressure on prices as retailers attempt to cut excess inventories. 
A slowdown in auto sales since January's rebound is widespread. However, dealers' inventories are in better shape, with several Districts reporting stocks to be at or below year-ago levels. Philadelphia and Chicago note that dealers are cautious about new orders because of slow sales. Minneapolis notes that some dealers are having financial problems and some consolidation may take place in 1990. Kansas City, Cleveland, and Dallas report that weak sales are associated with tightening credit availability. Reasons cited for the credit tightening range from tighter credit standards to personal credit history problems left over from earlier depressed times. 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based on information obtained before March 6, 1990. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
Manufacturing. Manufacturing activity is mixed, with Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis reporting manufacturing declines and most other Districts reporting moderate improvement. New York indicates that purchasing agent surveys indicate rising new orders and production. Capital goods producers in Cleveland and Chicago report a slow upward trend in orders. San Francisco's commercial aircraft industry is showing no sign of slowing and aircraft- related equipment producers in Boston are facing rising demand. Both Chicago and San Francisco report strong sales of farm machinery. However, Boston cites weakness in computers, auto parts, and paper. St. Louis and Philadelphia report weakness in employment and orders, particularly among durable goods industries. 
Only the weakness in the auto industry appears to be widespread. Atlanta notes that plant closings and layoffs in the auto industry are hurting suppliers, but no further weakening is expected. Auto output has already begun to revive in the Cleveland District, however, and most plants are expected to be running in the Chicago District by March. 
Construction and Real Estate. Construction activity is slowing in most Districts. New York reports that their ""boom"" in residential construction has subsided throughout the District, 
due to higher prices, lack of good land, and an easing of pent-up demand. Most observers are not anticipating a pickup in 1990. Commercial building has slowed in Atlanta because of overbuilding and slow employment growth. Construction activity is flat in Minneapolis and not expected to improve in the near future. Although San Francisco reports nonresidential construction around its District is mixed, overall construction activity is strongest in Chicago and San Francisco. Homebuilding in St. Louis has been rising, due partly to favorable weather conditions. Kansas City notes that mortgage loan demand is weak and is not expected to improve. 
Agriculture and Natural Resources. Improved economic conditions in the agricultural sector continue to buoy farm incomes. Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City report that the 
yields on the winter wheat crop are expected to range from near normal to above normal. Freeze damage to fruits and vegetables caused some problems in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, with 
prices of some produce rising to their highest levels since 1984. While most produce prices are expected to decline over the year, Atlanta notes that citrus prices are likely to remain high all year. Chicago and Minneapolis cite high livestock and dairy prices as bolstering farm income. Kansas City notes that farm income for livestock producers is doing better than for cash grain farmers. However, concerns were expressed throughout the farm belt that moisture levels in the soil are low, despite recent precipitation. Minneapolis notes some concern that below-normal precipitation could bring another drought to the Upper Midwest. 
Other resource-related industries are generally very strong. Minneapolis states that mining is one of the strongest sectors of the Upper Midwest economy, with iron and precious metal mines expanding capacity. Forest product industries are strong, with most plants running at capacity and many expanding capacity. However, forest product firms in San Francisco have been scaling back output as logging restrictions take effect. Oil and gas drilling in the Southwest is up sharply, although drilling activity is expected to moderate. Kansas City cites a seasonal decline in exploration and development of oil and gas in January, but that decline is coming off six consecutive months of increase. 
Financial Markets. Most Districts report that financial institutions are either less willing to extend credit or actually tightening credit terms. Atlanta particularly notes tightening of credit 
standards for real estate loans. Richmond cites a decline in the supply of real estate loans. Retailers in Boston and Philadelphia state that not only are sales being constrained, but retailers themselves are having difficulty ordering because of tighter credit availability. 
Loan demand also appears to be softening. Richmond and Kansas City report that demand for commercial and industrial loans has softened recently. Except for home equity loans, growth in consumer loan demand has weakened in Atlanta. New York notes that a widespread decline in interest rates has had no effect on loan demand, which is currently lower than a year ago. Loan volume in Philadelphia was up in early February from a year ago, but was slipping in mid-February.",1,0
1990-02-28,"Economic activity is expanding slowly in most of the nation, with conditions somewhat stronger in the West than the East. Retail sales in the holiday season ranged from ""disappointing"" in Boston to modest in Philadelphia and Atlanta and relatively strong in Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco; however, widespread discounting generally reduced store profits. Manufacturing activity is generally sluggish with production declines in some industries (autos, in particular) offsetting gains in others (such as commercial aircraft and oilfield equipment). Several Districts reported that the steel and computer industries, among others, may be ""bottoming out."" 
Unseasonably cold weather dampened construction activity in some areas, but real estate markets generally held steady. Cold or dry 
weather also adversely affected citrus, vegetable, and winter wheat crops. Other agricultural and resource-related sectors did moderately 
well. The outlook is for slow growth in all regions in 1990; some respondents expect improvement late in the year. Retail 
Retail results for the Christmas season were mixed. Most Districts in the eastern third of the nation -- Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta -- found sales up about 5 percent. New York 
*Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based on information obtained before January 13, 1990. This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 
respondents reported stronger sales and Boston somewhat weaker sales. Retailers in Districts farther west -- Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco -- had a better holiday season. Consumer durables, such as furniture and housewares, moved less briskly than apparel and other nondurables. Inventories of certain items were high in Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago, as Christmas sales ran below expectations and promotions failed to bring stocks into line. Auto sales were reported to be weak nationwide, although Chicago cited national data 
indicating that sales picked up at the turn of the year. Most Districts reported widespread discounting. In some 
Districts, especially steep discounting by department stores adversely affected sales at discount and specialty stores. 
Retailers expect flat sales or modest increases through the first six months of 1990. Results in the first weeks of January were said to be encouraging. Manufacturing 
Manufacturing activity was reported to be slow in most of the Districts. In Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, however, some industries were said to be showing signs of ""bottoming out"" and were posting slight gains in orders from year-ago levels. Food, apparel, lumber, commercial aircraft, and farm, oilfield, and some electric equipment all made gains. Defense, construction, and automotive products continued to face weak demand; however, respondents from Chicago and Cleveland suggested that current cutbacks in auto production may prove adequate to eliminate the industry's inventory overhang. Orders for first-quarter delivery also suggest a gradual improvement for steel. 
iii 
Although a Minneapolis computer firm recently made a large layoff, Dallas and San Francisco reported signs of a pickup in that industry as well. Manufacturers in the Chicago, Dallas, and Boston Districts found that significant foreign sales are helping to offset weak domestic demand. 
Manufacturing employment was reportedly flat to down compared with earlier in 1989, with firms in the New York, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts facing major layoffs in autos, aerospace, or computers. Except for fuel, input prices were said to be steady or falling. Scattered evidence suggests that selling prices were also steady or falling, with discounting occurring in some industries. 
Despite weakness in autos and parts of aerospace, New York and San Francisco reported major investment projects by firms in those 
industries. Boston, Cleveland, and Atlanta also indicated that several respondents plan capital spending above 1989 levels. 
Most manufacturers expected slow growth in 1990, with a weak first half followed by gradual improvement. Despite widespread public concern 
about possible defense cutbacks, defense contractors in the Boston and St. Louis Districts expected declines in defense spending to be gradual, with limited local impact. Agriculture and Natural Resources 
December's severe cold weather adversely affected some agricultural sectors and led to large increases in fruit and vegetable 
prices. Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City also noted possible or confirmed damage to winter wheat crops due to cold, dry weather. 
Reports from other agricultural and resource-based sectors were 
more positive. Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all mentioned high cattle prices and strength in the beef or dairy 
industries. Atlanta and St. Louis referred to sharp energy price increases, believed to be temporary and weather-related, while Atlanta, 
Kansas City, and San Francisco described greater oil and gas exploration or drilling activity. Mining and lumber industries were reported to be doing well in the Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts. Banking 
Regional financial conditions varied by District and by type of loan. Bankers in Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, the Pacific Northwest and central California reported increased demand for business or consumer loans. By contrast, New York District banks saw a decline in demand for most types of credit. While Philadelphia lenders experienced an increase from year-earlier levels in total loans outstanding, they noted a recent decline in loan demand. Mortgage lending is down, according to New York, Atlanta and St. Louis institutions, while San Francisco mentioned that some Arizona and Alaska banks face real-estate related problems. Several Districts noted that banks have initiated credit reviews and were 
tightening criteria for making loans - especially for real estate purposes. Real Estate 
Most Districts discussing real estate reported steady or modestly improved conditions. Atlanta, Kansas City, and Philadelphia noted some signs of weakness, however. Expected declines in mortgage interest rates provided some reason for optimism in the real estate outlook. 
Homebuilding activity was mixed. Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, 
and San Francisco showed strength in at least some parts of their Districts, but New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City experienced slow or declining activity. 
Reductions in home prices in Boston and the New York metropolitan area have boosted sales activity but have not eliminated the oversupply 
of homes available for resale in either region. Real estate prices were also said to be declining in St. Louis; by contrast, they were reported steady in Kansas City and up sharply in the state of Washington. Sales of expensive homes were said to be holding up well in parts of Miami, while lower-priced homes were the top performers in California and Boston. 
Nonresidential property markets were generally slow. Office vacancies rose in Manhattan and Florida, and Atlanta reported slower 
pre-leasing of new projects in its downtown. Dallas, in contrast, found increases in office building occupancy.",0,0
