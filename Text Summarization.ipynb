      " History [ edit ] \n",
      " The  history of natural language processing  (NLP) generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods.\n",
      "In 1950,  Alan Turing  published an article titled \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \" which proposed what is now called the  Turing test  as a criterion of intelligence.\n",
      " The  Georgetown experiment  in 1954 involved fully  automatic translation  of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem. [2]   However, real progress was much slower, and after the  ALPAC report  in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced.  Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first  statistical machine translation  systems were developed.\n",
      " Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were  SHRDLU , a natural language system working in restricted \" blocks worlds \" with restricted vocabularies, and  ELIZA , a simulation of a  Rogerian psychotherapist , written by  Joseph Weizenbaum  between 1964 and 1966.  Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\".\n",
      " During the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual  ontologies \", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, many  chatterbots  were written including  PARRY ,  Racter , and  Jabberwacky .\n",
      " Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of  machine learning  algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see  Moore's law ) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of  Chomskyan  theories of linguistics (e.g.  transformational grammar ), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of  corpus linguistics  that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing. [3]  Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as  decision trees , produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.  However,  part-of-speech tagging  introduced the use of  hidden Markov models  to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on  statistical models , which make soft,  probabilistic  decisions based on attaching  real-valued  weights to the features making up the input data. The  cache language models  upon which many  speech recognition  systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.\n",
      " Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of  machine translation , due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed.  These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual  textual corpora  that had been produced by the  Parliament of Canada  and the  European Union  as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.  However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.\n",
      " Recent research has increasingly focused on  unsupervised  and  semi-supervised learning  algorithms.  Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.  Generally, this task is much more difficult than  supervised learning , and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.  However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the  World Wide Web ), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough  time complexity  to be practical.\n",
      " In the 2010s,  representation learning  and  deep neural network -style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques [4] [5]  can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling, [6] \n",
      "parsing, [7] [8]  and many others. Popular techniques include the use of  word embeddings  to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term  neural machine translation  (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that were used in  statistical machine translation  (SMT).\n",
      " \n",
      " Rule-based vs. statistical NLP [ edit ] \n",
      " In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by hand-coding a set of rules, [9] [10]  e.g. by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for  stemming .\n",
      "However, this is rarely robust to natural language variation.\n",
      " Since the so-called \"statistical revolution\" [11] [12] \n",
      "in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on  machine learning .\n",
      " The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using  statistical inference  to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large  corpora  of typical real-world examples (a  corpus  (plural, \"corpora\") is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations).\n",
      " Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks. These algorithms take as input a large set of \"features\" that are generated from the input data. Some of the earliest-used algorithms, such as  decision trees , produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to the systems of hand-written rules that were then common. Increasingly, however, research has focused on  statistical models , which make soft,  probabilistic  decisions based on attaching  real-valued  weights to each input feature. Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.\n",
      " Systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules:\n",
      " \n",
      " The learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus on the most common cases, whereas when writing rules by hand it is often not at all obvious where the effort should be directed. \n",
      " Automatic learning procedures can make use of statistical-inference algorithms to produce models that are robust to unfamiliar input (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and to erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted). Generally, handling such input gracefully with hand-written rules—or, more generally, creating systems of hand-written rules that make soft decisions—is extremely difficult, error-prone and time-consuming. \n",
      " Systems based on automatically learning the rules can be made more accurate simply by supplying more input data. However, systems based on hand-written rules can only be made more accurate by increasing the complexity of the rules, which is a much more difficult task.  In particular, there is a limit to the complexity of systems based on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable.  However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process. \n",
      " Major evaluations and tasks [ edit ] \n",
      " The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.\n",
      " Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they are frequently subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.\n",
      " \n",
      " Syntax [ edit ] \n",
      " Grammar induction [13] \n",
      " Generate a  formal grammar  that describes a language's syntax. \n",
      " Lemmatization \n",
      " The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma. \n",
      " Morphological segmentation \n",
      " Separate words into individual  morphemes  and identify the class of the morphemes.  The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the  morphology  (i.e. the structure of words) of the language being considered.  English  has fairly simple morphology, especially  inflectional morphology , and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. \"open, opens, opened, opening\") as separate words.  In languages such as  Turkish  or  Meitei , [14]  a highly  agglutinated  Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms. \n",
      " Part-of-speech tagging \n",
      " Given a sentence, determine the  part of speech  ( POS ) for each word.  Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple  parts of speech .  For example, \"book\" can be a  noun  (\"the book on the table\") or  verb  (\"to book a flight\"); \"set\" can be a  noun ,  verb  or  adjective ; and \"out\" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.  Some languages have more such ambiguity than others. [ dubious    –  discuss ]   Languages with little  inflectional morphology , such as  English , are particularly prone to such ambiguity.  Chinese  is prone to such ambiguity because it is a  tonal language  during verbalization. Such inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning. \n",
      " Parsing \n",
      " Determine the  parse tree  (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence.  The  grammar  for  natural languages  is  ambiguous  and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses.  In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human). There are two primary types of parsing, Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing. Dependency Parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like Primary Objects and predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing focuses on building out the Parse Tree using a  Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar  (PCFG). See also:  Stochastic grammar . \n",
      " Sentence breaking  (also known as  sentence boundary disambiguation ) \n",
      " Given a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries.  Sentence boundaries are often marked by  periods  or other  punctuation marks , but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g. marking  abbreviations ). \n",
      " Stemming \n",
      " The process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their root form. (e.g. \"close\" will be the root for \"closed\", \"closing\", \"close\", \"closer\" etc.). \n",
      " Word segmentation \n",
      " Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words.  For a language like  English , this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces.  However, some written languages like  Chinese ,  Japanese  and  Thai  do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the  vocabulary  and  morphology  of words in the language. Sometimes this process is also used in cases like Bag of Words (BOW) creation in data mining. \n",

      " Machine translation \n",
      " Automatically translate text from one human language to another.  This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed \" AI-complete \", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) in order to solve properly. \n",
      " Named entity recognition  (NER) \n",
      " Given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization). Although  capitalization  can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient.  For example, the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g.  Chinese  or  Arabic ) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names. For example,  German  capitalizes all  nouns , regardless of whether they are names, and  French  and  Spanish  do not capitalize names that serve as  adjectives . \n",
      " Natural language generation \n",
      " Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language. \n",
      " Natural language understanding \n",
      " Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as  first-order logic  structures that are easier for  computer  programs to manipulate. Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as  closed-world assumption  (CWA) vs.  open-world assumption , or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.

      " Given an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text. \n",
      " Question answering \n",
      " Given a human-language question, determine its answer.  Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as \"What is the capital of Canada?\"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as \"What is the meaning of life?\"). Recent works have looked at even more complex questions. [16] \n",
      " Recognizing Textual entailment \n",
      " Given two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other's negation, or allows the other to be either true or false. [17] \n",
      " Relationship extraction \n",

      " Sentiment analysis  (see also  multimodal sentiment analysis ) \n",
      " Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine \"polarity\" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in the social media, for the purpose of marketing. \n",
      " Topic segmentation  and recognition \n",
      " Given a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment. \n",
      " Word sense disambiguation \n",
      " Many words have more than one  meaning ; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.  For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a dictionary or from an online resource such as  WordNet . \n",

      " Automatic summarization \n",
      " Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text.  Often used to provide summaries of text of a known type, such as research papers, articles in the financial section of a newspaper. \n",
      " Coreference resolution \n",
      " Given a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words (\"mentions\") refer to the same objects (\"entities\").  Anaphora resolution  is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up  pronouns  with the nouns or names to which they refer. The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called \"bridging relationships\" involving  referring expressions . For example, in a sentence such as \"He entered John's house through the front door\", \"the front door\" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to). \n",
      " Discourse analysis \n",
      " This rubric includes a number of related tasks.  One task is identifying the  discourse  structure of connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast).  Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the  speech acts  in a chunk of text (e.g. yes-no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.). \n",
      " Speech [ edit ] \n",
      " Speech recognition \n",
      " Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  This is the opposite of  text to speech  and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed \" AI-complete \" (see above).  In  natural speech  there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus  speech segmentation  is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below). In most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed  coarticulation , so the conversion of the  analog signal  to discrete characters can be a very difficult process. Also, given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents, the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent. \n",

    "As we can see, the extractive method does not produce the best results. Some parts of the summary make sense while other parts dont really make sense. It is possible that we could improve the performance by cleaning up the input text more. Even with improvements extractive text summarization often reads very choppy which has lead to the creating of abstractive text summarization where neural networks create new sentences to summarize the text.
